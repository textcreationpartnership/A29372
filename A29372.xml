         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Apoſtle having exhorted the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians</hi> in the former part of this Epiſtle to perſeverance in grace, as you read in the former Chapter, verſ. 8. <hi>For now we live, if ye ſtand fast in the Lord;</hi> and at verſ. 13. of the ſame Chapter, <hi>To the end he may ſtabliſh your hearts unblameable in holineſs before God even our Father:</hi> he doth here in this Chapter exhort them to Chriſtian Progreſſion, growing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in Grace. So in this firſt Verſe of this fourth Chapter.</p>
               <p>In this Exhortation three things are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Matter which he exhorteth them unto, in the later end of the verſe, That they would <hi>abound more and more in the work of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Manner of his Exhortation, and that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45432:3"/> is with much earneſtneſs: <hi>We beſeech you brethren, and exhort you;</hi> and, <hi>We exhort you by the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Reaſon or Motive that he uſes to preſs this Exhortation: <hi>That as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk, and to pleaſe God.</hi> Ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay that ye have not been taught: for both I and others have taught you, and <hi>ye have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of us how ye ought to walk, and to pleaſe God.</hi> Now therefore ſeeing that ye have received this of us, ſee that ye <hi>abound more and more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ye abound more and more. Beza</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they have the words read thus: <hi>So that ye excel more and more.</hi> I will not diſpute the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation. There is one great Truth which the words at firſt view do hold forth unto you; and that is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is the earnest deſire of thoſe that are faithful in the work of the Miniſtry, and ought to be the care of all the Saints themſelves, to abound in the work of the Lord yet more and more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are not onely to have grace, but to <hi>abound</hi> and <hi>grow.</hi> So he exhorts them in verſ. 10. of the ſame Chapter: <hi>But we beſeech you brethren that ye increaſe more and more.</hi> The Apoſtle is expreſs in this Exhortation: <hi>But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> And in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>Having therefore theſe promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Text it is called <hi>ABO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NDING more and more;</hi> in verſ. 10. it's call'd <hi>INCREASING more and more:</hi> by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> it's call'd <hi>GROWING in grace:</hi> by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> it's call'd <hi>PERFECTING of holineſs.</hi> Now this you
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45432:3"/> will finde, if you look into <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. the end of Chriſts aſcenſion, and the end of all our Miniſtry; of all our preaching, and your bearing, that ye may abound in the work of the Lord more and more, and that ye may be made perfect. <hi>He that deſcended, in the ſame alſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that aſcended up far above all heavens: and he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſome Evangelists, and ſome Pastors and Teachers; for the perfecting of the Saints; till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Christ.</hi> Then in verſ. 15. <hi>But ſpeaking the truth in love, may gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w up into him in all things which is the head, even Christ.</hi> So that you ſee this to be our great care that do preach the Word, and the endeavour of all thoſe that hear it, that ye may abound in the work of the Lord yet more and more; that you may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, that ye may grow in grace. And this you will finde to be <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>ONE thing,</hi> Phil. 3. 13. <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I count not my ſelf to have apprehended; but this one thing I do,</hi> (ſo you read it) <hi>forgetting thoſe things that are behinde, and reaching forth to thoſe things which are before, I preſs towards the mark,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This one thing I do,</hi> ſo you read it: but the words <hi>[I do]</hi> are not in the Greek, but thus: <hi>This one thing. Brethren, I count not my ſelf to have appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; but this is the one thing, forgetting thoſe things that are behinde, and reaching forth to thoſe things that are before.</hi> Our Lord and Saviour Chriſt he had his <hi>one thing neceſſary;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> had his <hi>one thing</hi> too; <hi>One thing have I deſired:</hi> and here now <hi>Paul</hi> he hath his one thing, one thing for the Saints, and that is this, <hi>We forget what is past, and preſs on to that which is before,</hi> labouring to increaſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45432:4"/> and to <hi>grow in grace,</hi> and <hi>perfecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this you ſhall finde to be the end of all thoſe afflictions which we meet withal from God the Father. God the Father is unwilling to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict his children, he would not do it unleſs it were neceſſary; why the end of his affliction we finde to be this, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this you ſhall find to be the end of Chriſts coming, as you read in <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 10. <hi>I am come, that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</hi> There lies a poor ſoul, ſaith Chriſt, dead in treſpaſſes and ſins; I am not onely come to give life unto that ſoul, (ſpiritual life) but that he may have it in more abundance. So that it is not onely our duty to <hi>have</hi> grace, but we muſt <hi>abound therein more and more;</hi> we muſt <hi>grow</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And, my Beloved,</p>
               <p>It is not onely the duty of the Saints to do ſo, but they will, and they do do this. So ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, I will praiſe thee yet more.</hi> And if you look <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. you ſhall finde that this was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> at verſ 19. that her works were <hi>more at the last then at the first.</hi> Pray minde it; it is a great and a glorious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation: O that it were the commendation of all the Churches now being! With ſome it is contrary, their works are more at the firſt then at the laſt; but, ſaith he concerning the Church of <hi>Thyatira, I know thy works, and thy charity, and the last to be more then the first.</hi> Where there is a <hi>truth</hi> of grace, there will be a <hi>growth.</hi> Read I pray
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45432:4"/> what is ſaid in <hi>Prov.</hi> 4 18. <hi>But the path of the just is as the ſhining light, that ſhineth more and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the perfect day. That ſhineth more and more.</hi> Look how it is with the light of the day, ſo with the grace of God in the hearts of his people; the light is ſmall and little at the beginning of the day, but it ſhineth more and more, it grows brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and brighter unto perfect day: and ſo though grace in Gods people be but little at firſt dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet that light and grace that is in them, it grows every day brighter and brighter unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect day.</p>
               <p>I but there is a great deal of danger, through the great oppoſition that the Saints meet withal, that their light ſhould be quite put out: they are in great danger to looſe all, for they meet with much oppoſition, yea and the rather, becauſe that they do grow.

               <p>God hath a hand upon all the hands of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt his children; and it is ſo far from

                  </gap> therefore upon that account of the promiſe, they ſhall have it in more abundance. And ſo in that place of <hi>Iſaiah, He that waiteth upon the Lord ſhall renew his ſtrength, he ſhall mount up as with eagles wings:</hi> there ſhall be an addition of ſtrength unto him, he ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and abound yet more and more. In Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-phraſe, grace it is call'd <hi>life:</hi> indeed it is our ſpiritual life. Now you finde that all your ſublunary lives, where they are there is growth: the plant or the tree it grows, becauſe it hath life; and the beaſt grows, becauſe he hath life. The Sun, Moon and Stars, though they move apace, they do not grow; why? becauſe they have no life: they have light, but no life, and ſo they grow not: but all the people of God they have a ſpiritual life, and ſo they will, and do, and muſt, and cannot but grow. They make God himſelf their uttermoſt and their laſt end. What a man makes his laſt and his uttermoſt end, that he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to grow up unto more and more; he never hath enough of it. Some men make riches their laſt and their uttermoſt end; and they never have enough. Some make God their end, and riches a means to ſerve God; they can have enough: but when a man makes riches his laſt and his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt end, and never ſtints himſelf, he never thinks he hath enough. Now the children of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45432:5"/> God they make God himſelf their laſt and their uttermoſt end, his ſervice and grace; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they never have enough: they cannot have enough, but muſt labour to grow and increaſe, and abound more and more.</p>
               <p>And beſides, they look upon grace, and growth and increaſe in grace, as their greateſt excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. What a man looks upon as his excellency, that he doth much deſire. Some place an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie in fine Gardens; and if they ſee a dainty flower in anothers Garden, they will never be at quiet till they have the like in their own Garden, becauſe therein they place an excellencie. Now there are many increaſes in the world, wherein men place great excellencie, and therein they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to abound more and more. And now ſaith a godly creature, A rich man looks upon riches as his excellencie, and therefore would yet have more: an honourable man looks upon cred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t as his excellencie, and therefore he would have more: So do I look upon grace as my excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and therefore I muſt yet have more. A god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man having once taſted of the ſweetneſs that is in the ways of God, Oh, ſaith he, 'tis ſo ſweet, I muſt yet have more: give me more of this; though I die for it, yet give me more of this. He doth grow, and he cannot but grow and abound yet more and more.</p>

               <p> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For anſwer: As a man may have grace and not know it, ſo he may have grace and not perceive it: his earneſt deſire of having more and more ſtill, makes him forget what he hath.</p>
               <p>The more grace one hath, the more he doth ſee ſin; and the more a man ſees his ſin, the more his own grace will be hidden from his own eyes. Godly men do oftentimes meaſure themſelves by Metaphors; as ſometimes we that are Preachers of the Word, we fall upon a Scripture-metaphor, as where Chriſt is call'd a <hi>ſun, a ſhield,</hi> or <hi>bread;</hi> and we run the Metaphor off its legs, further then the Holy-ghoſt did intend: ſo ſometimes we do. So it is with Chriſtians too; they fall upon a Scripture-metaphor, and they run it and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves off their legs, beyond what the Holy-ghoſt doth intend. For example, increaſe of grace in Scripture-phraſe is called a growth: now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Chriſtian cannot finde his own ſpiritual increaſe anſwerable to all outward growth, therefore he thinks that he doth not increaſe in grace: whereas there is a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a ſpiritual increaſe, and an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward growth, in many things: As now, a mans body grows, but all the parts of his body do not grow out of his head; but now in our ſpiritual growth it is ſo, as you read in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>And not holding the head, from which all the body by joynts and bands having nouriſhment miniſtred, and knit together, increaſeth with the increaſe of God.</hi> Why here our ſpiritual increaſe in all the members comes from the head: it is not ſo in our outward growth; all the members of our body do not grow out of our head; but in our ſpiritual growth it is ſo. And ſo many other differences might be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45432:6"/> given. But now becauſe that Chriſtians do not finde their ſpiritual increaſe every way anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to an outward growth, therefore they call all into queſtion many times, and ſay, Oh I do not grow in grace, and ſo I have no grace at all. Celeſtial bodies, as the Sun, Moon and Stars, they move apace, and may run hundreds of miles in an hour; yet when you look upon them, they ſeem to be fixt, and you ſee no motion: but look now upon your terreſtrial bodies, men or beaſts, moving before you, you ſee them move. So now, when a man looks upon his increaſe in riches, he may perceive that; but when you caſt your eyes upon thoſe celeſtial bodies, Saints, you will think they are fixt, and they move not at all: and ſo you will think ſometimes concerning your ſelves, that you do not move at all, and yet move, and ſtir, and increaſe, and abound more and more. So that I ſay, firſt, As a man may have grace, and not know it; ſo 'tis poſſible for a man to increaſe in grace, and not perceive it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Oh but I fear that I do not increaſe and abound more and more; for I do nothing now more for God then what I have done before, will ſome ſay. I pray now, and I did pray before; I hear the Word, and I did hear before; I read the Scripture in private, and I did read before; I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine mine own heart, and I did ſo before: I find no addition at all made to my ſpiritual conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; what I did before, that I do now; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I fear that I am not grown in grace, and therefore that I never had any grace at all: for where there is truth, there will be growth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, for anſwer to this, you muſt know that growth in grace doth not always conſiſt in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45432:7"/> doing of other works for the kinde, but in doing the ſame works over and over again better then before: As now, when one learns to write, when a man hath attained to a great perfection in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he doth not make other letters then he made at firſt; he makes the ſame letters that he did, onely he makes them better, and ſets them cloſer. So now, in your growth and increaſe in grace, you muſt not think that you ſhall make oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But ſecondly, It may argue more grace, to do the ſame work afterwards. Pray con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ider this: I ſay, it may ſometimes argue more grace to do the ſame work afterwards. As for example: ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man be an old man, or an old woman, when this perſon was young he pray'd it may be an hour or two hours in a day; now he is grown old, and his body is infirm and weak, to do the ſame thing now, argues more grace now then before: and therefore if you look into <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. you ſhall finde that this is made the growing of thoſe that are old, that they ſhall bring forth fruit ſtill: <hi>The righteous ſhall flouriſh like the palm-tree; he ſhall grow like a cedar in Lebanon;</hi> he ſhall grow. <hi>Thoſe that be planted in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the courts of our God.</hi> Well, and what ſhall he do when he is old? At verſ. 14. <hi>They ſhall bring forth fruit in old age.</hi> He doth not ſay that they ſhall grow; but this bringing forth fruit ſtill in old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is his growth: ſo that ſometimes it may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue more grace to do the ſame work afterwards then before.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:45432:7"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Oh but yet ſome will ſay, I am afraid that I do not grow in grace, and ſo indeed that I never had any truth of grace; for now I am much declin'd: at the firſt my heart it was mightily enlarged for God, and now it's ſtraitned. O what freedom once <hi>I</hi> had! I remember a time when I went to prayer, and wept, and mourned, and my heart broke and melted; but now my heart is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding cold, and very dead, and therefore I am even afraid that I am declined, and that I do not grow in grace, and ſo that I never had grace at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Give me leave to fix here a little, and to anſwer this Objection, that I may ſpeak a word of ſtay to thoſe that are weary and troubled. And now as your Objection ariſes, ſo ſhall my Anſwer riſe.

                  </gap>n may increaſe, and yet think that he is much decreaſed. For, my Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſometimes, yea often, good people do mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure themſelves by that firſt affection which they had at their firſt turning to God; and then the change was ſpecifical, &amp; afterwards the change is gradual. When a man is firſt converte and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to God, then he is turned from in to God, from ſin to grace, from the world to Chriſt: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he doth not change from the world to Chriſt, but he changes from grace to grace, from glory to glory: 'tis but a gradual change after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and therefore the change at the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſpecifical thing, his affections were high then. At our firſt converſion and turning to God, all things are ſpan-new; and we are apt to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45432:8"/> be much affected with new things, and therefore the aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctions muſt needs be very much up and raiſed at the firſt, and when a man doth firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and turn to God, and leave the world: God the Father doth as it were take the poor ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his arms when 'tis a babe, and he doth beſtow many deſires upon it; and he gives out many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, to weigh down thoſe diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that the ſoul ſhall meet withal in parting with the world. But now afterwards, when a man is more able to go alone, poſſibly he doth not meet with theſe; now ſhall a man think there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that all is naught, and that he hath no grace at all, becauſe he doth not feel what he had then? Yet how often is this!</p>
               <p>But beſides, good people do miſtake becauſe of their ignorance, whereby they call that ſin which is grace, and that grace which is ſin. Thus I mean: it's a great ſin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> a man to doubt of Gods love, and to lie down upon his face, and to be diſcouraged, as if there were no hope for him in God: why many that are weak now, they look upon this as a great vertue, to doubt of their condition, and to call all into queſtion: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they are freed from theſe doubtings, and ſo they do grow in grace: but becauſe they do look upon theſe doubtings as marks of vertue, they think becauſe they have loſt theſe, that now they are quite declined, whereas indeed they are grown in grace.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, in anſwer to this, you muſt know that our Chriſtian growth is fourfold.</p>

               </list>
               <p>A man grows theſe four ways ſpiritually.</p>
               <p>Sometimes his affection grows more intenſe hot then it was before: ſometimes a mans growth is in regard of extention, his affections of love or joy extending to other objects then before. So in <hi>Hoſea</hi> our growth is deſcribed to be a <hi>ſpreading of the branches.</hi> And ſometimes a man grows when he is more firm and rooted in the way of God; and ſo our ſpiritual growth in that place of <hi>Hoſea</hi> is deſcribed by our <hi>taking root down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> And ſometimes a man is ſaid to grow when he is more ſpiritual. Beloved, weak Chriſtians look altogether at the intenſneſs of their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and if they do not finde their affections ſo intenſe as they were before, then they break forth and ſay, Oh now I am declined, and now I am decayed, and I have loſt my firſt love; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there is a growth in regard of extenſion; as a man or beaſt he may attain to his full talneſs, and after that he may batten and ſpread more: ſo in grace, a mans gracc may ſpread more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and yet poſſibly not ſo intenſe in regard of ſome affections, as it was at the firſt. Now a Fountain or Spring that hath but one ſtream, and afterwards that one ſtream be divided in many ſtreams; if an unskilful man look upon it, he ſaith, How comes this to paſs, that this Fountain is dryed up? here was a full ſtream before, and now there is not. But now ſaith a skilful man that ſtands by him, Now there are many ſtreams, and ſo there is rather the more water, now it is divided into more ſtreams. And ſo it is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of grace; at the firſt a mans grace doth run out much in one chanel, afterwards it is divided
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45432:9"/> into more ſtreams, and it ſpread<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>k, becauſe they do not finde ſo full a ſtream in the ſame chanel as before, though there be many ſtreams now that there were not before, they queſtion all, and they ſay they are abated, and they are declin'd, and they have loſt their firſt love.</p>
               <p>But again, whereas thou ſayſt it is not now with thee as it was before; I ſay to thee, poor doubting heart, wherever thou art or ſtandeſt, I ſay unto thee from the Lord, Thou haſt more now then thou hadſt before; as thus: for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a childe that heretofore ſerved his father for wages, and doth now ſerve out of love, and not for wages, it may be he doth not do ſo much work as he did before, yet I ſay to you, If he doth but hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſo much out of love, he doth more then he did before when he wrought for wages; now the work is more out of love to God: heretofore you were much grieved and troubled for ſin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and you were therefore grieved, that your ſin might be pardoned; I but now you grieve for your ſin becauſe it is pardoned: I tell you, One tear from you of theſe Goſpel-tears, are more then a bottle-full of all thoſe legal tears that you had before, man or woman, and therefore there is no reaſon why thou ſhouldſt be dejected, and ſay thus, I am declin'd, and I have loſt my firſt love, and I do not grow in grace, and therefore I never had any truth of grace at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But you will ſay unto me then, If a man may grow and increaſe in grace, and yet think that he is decreaſed; what certain Signes are there, whereby a man may know that he doth grow in grace, and that he doth abound yet more and more?</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:45432:9"/>
               <p> Beloved, I ſhall not give you any negative ſigns, but I ſhall make mention of ſome things, which if you have, and can find, you may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſay, you are grown in Grace. But miſtake not, I do not ſay, that if you do not find theſe, that therefore you ſhould conclude that you are not grown. I come rather to comfort and to lift up the weary Soul, then to trouble it: but, I ſay, If you do find theſe, you are certainly grown in Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Firſt, The great work of the Goſpel it is to believe; and if you can rely more upon Chriſt in the time of your temptations then heretofore, ſurely you are grown in Grace.</p>
               <p>If you do find again a greater ſweetneſs in the ways of God, then you have found heretofore, certainly you are grown: when we come and look upon a flower, we look at the colour of the flower, and the ſmell of the flower; but the Bee doth not regard the colour of the flower, or the ſmell of the flower, but the Bee regards the ſweetneſs of the flower: ſo at our firſt coming into the ways of God, then we look at the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and how they appear; but afterwards, the more Grace you have, the more ſweetneſs you find; and if you find more ſweetneſs, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly you are grown more.</p>
               <p>Again, If that you are more able to turn from the exerciſe of one Grace to another, and of one Duty unto another, then you were, this argues you are grown, if you be able to mingle Graces together: a weak Chriſtian is all for one work, humiliation for ſin committed, and it's true, we ought to be much humbled: I ſay, a weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is all for one work, but the ſtronger you
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45432:10"/> grow, the more you will be able to mingle Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together, and to turn from one to another. As now, if one learn to ſing, when one hath but little skill, poſſibly a man may ſing one tune; but the more a man grows in skill, the more he will be able readily to turn from one tune to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So in Grace, a man may be able to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Graces more; and therefore our growth is ſo deſcribed, as you ſhall hear by and by in that of <hi>Peter, Add unto your Faith vertue, and to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue knowledge,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Again, If you be able to go on in the ways of God more, without whip, or rod, or without ſpur, it argues you are grown more; give me leave to expreſs it thus: A Horſe at the firſt, till he be acquainted with the Rode and way, he is ridden with a whip and with a ſpur; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when he is well uſed to the way, you may lay the Bridle upon his head, and he need none of the ſpur and whip; why? becauſe he is now uſed to the way: and ſo when Chriſtians come on at the firſt, then they are whipt on with more fear; but now when the reins ſeem to be laid upon the neck, they go the better and the faſter: when they can go without that whipping and the rod, it argues that they are uſed more to the way of God, then they were uſed before.</p>
               <p>But further, the more a man is able to go out unto others for counſel, ſpiritual admonition, conſolation, or reprehenſion, the more he is grown, and he will grow in Grace.</p>
               <p>I'le propound you a Parable: ſuppoſe three men that are ſick and weak; one is extream ill, and the Phyſitian comes to his bed-ſide, and he ſpits in his Phyſitians face, and will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:45432:10"/>
               <p> Another man he doth not deal ſo by the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, he lies upon his bed, but he cannot ſtir off his bed; he lies upon his bed, and he hears the counſel of the Phyſitian, and he takes his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>A third man he is weak indeed, but he is able to go abroad, and he goes to the Phyſitians houſe for his counſel and direction. I pray, which of all theſe three men are the moſt healthy? ſurely, you will ſay, the latter is more healthy then the ſecond, and the ſecond more then the third. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, there are theſe three ſorts of people, one that when ſpiritual Phyſick is brought to them, they ſpit in the Phyſitians face, and they will have none. Others they are not ſo bad, but yet notwithſtanding they keep their beds, as it were, and do not go forth for counſel.</p>
               <p>But there is a third ſort of ſinners, that finding their ſouls ill at eaſe, they can go forth for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and go out for admonition, and go out for reprehenſion. It may be that all theſe three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions have paſt over ſome of you: you can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the time when you did kick and fling, and ſpit in the Phyſicians face, as it were, and you would none at all; afterwards you lay more ſtill, but yet ſate, and did not ſtir out: I but now you are able God be thanked to go out to the Phyſician, or to ſuch and ſuch Saints, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen your condition before them; Oh thus it's with me, Oh thus it's with me! come, lay on ſome Admonition, or lay on ſome healing Plaiſter, ſome Reprehenſion, ſome Conſolation; good Sir pitie me; and the like. Now this argues more health then before.</p>
               <p>Again, the more you are able to do the work
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45432:11"/> of the Lord without noiſe, the more doth it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue that you are grown in grace. Beloved, Jeſus Chriſt was a perfect workman, and did the work of the Lord perfectly, and he made no noiſe; it is ſaid of him, that <hi>he did not lift up his voice in the ſtreets.</hi> Young Chriſtians make a great noiſe in the work of God: one he cries out, Oh I am damn'd, I am damn'd! and another cries out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame kind, Oh I am damn'd, I am damn'd! and wring their hands in the family, and make a great noiſe when there is a work of God upon their hearts; like to your young Scholars, when firſt of all they learn their books, they read with a great noiſe: afterwards, when they are grown men, and read better, they read ſilent, and make no noiſe. So now I ſay, Thou man or woman, art thou able to do the work of the Lord in a more ſilent and ſweet Goſpel-way then hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou didſt? this argues that thou art more grown then thou wert heretofore.</p>
               <p>And further, if you know Chriſt more, you are grown more; the Apoſtle puts them both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: <hi>Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of Jeſus Christ.</hi>

               <p>But take one more. If that you do as much as before, and deny your doing more then you did before, then you are grown in grace. One man doth much, and denies himſelf little; another doth much, and denies himſelf much: who hath moſt grace of theſe two? The husband-man will tell you, that when the ear of corn is not ſo ripe, it ſtands bolt-upright; but when it's more ripe, then it hangs down its head, and looks to the earth: and ſo heretofore it may be you were much in prayer, and in duty, you wept much;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45432:11"/> and it was well that you were much in duty and humiliation for ſin; but it may be then you reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon your duties, and denied your ſelf little. I but now you are as much, but you have ſeen more of the free grace of God, and the love of God in Chriſt, and now you deny your duties more, and reſt leſs upon them then you did; this is a growth now; and where theſe things are, you may conclude that you are grown. And I ſay to every ſoul here, Is there any one that doth finde theſe things? thou art the man or woman that doth grow in grace, and doth increaſe; therefore be of good comfort, thou art not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd, thou art not abated, thou haſt truth of grace, thou haſt growth of grace.</p>

                  <hi>Quest.</hi> I but whether I have or I have not, you will ſay, ſurely it is my duty to have; and what ſhall I do that I may grow in grace? I hope the Lord hath begun ſavingly upon my heart; but what ſhall I do that I may abound yet more and more, and increaſe in grace?</p>
               <p>I muſt not be large here; give me leave to ſay ſome things to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt of all, obſerve what thoſe ways of God are, unto which he hath promiſed increaſe; and Oh let your feet be found ſtanding there: he hath promiſed to thoſe that exerciſe; <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given.</hi> It is oppoſed to <hi>laying up the talent in a napkin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He hath promiſed increaſe to thoſe that wait upon him: <hi>Thoſe that wait upon the Lord ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He hath promiſed increaſe to thoſe whoſe feet ſtand in the courts of the houſe of the Lord, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 12. <hi>The righteous ſhall flouriſh like a palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But ſuppoſe that a mans feet do not ſtand in the court of the Lords houſe, ſuppoſe a man be not planted in the houſe of the Lord, can he not grow in grace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes: mark what follows in verſ. 5, 6, 7. all growth of grace is not inſtal'd upon one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſtrength is in thee.</hi> He had ſaid before, <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe that dwell in thy houſe:</hi> but ſuppoſe a man be driven out, and cannot dwell in Gods houſe, ſhall he not be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſhall he not grow? <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſtrength is in thee, and in whoſe heart are the ways of them, who paſſing through the valley of Baca, make it a well; the rain alſo filleth the pools: they go from ſtrength to ſtrength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.</hi> They may grow too; but then it's upon theſe three Conditions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ways of God muſt be in their hearts: <hi>In whoſe heart are the ways of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They muſt look upon that condition as a <hi>valley of Baca,</hi> a mourning valley, verſ. 6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, they muſt be abundant in private duty and exerciſe, <hi>digging up of pits;</hi> and then the rain falls, and <hi>fills thoſe pits;</hi> and thus <hi>they ſhall go from ſtrength to ſtrength.</hi> But the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe is promiſed to thoſe whoſe feet do ſtand in the court of the houſe of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Again, would you know how you may grow in grace? Beloved, let your eye be ſtedfaſt upon
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45432:12"/> the greater and higher matters and objects of the Goſpel. The Apoſtle for this end doth lay the great things of the Goſpel before the people, and prays for them, that they may be <hi>filled with all the fulneſs of God.</hi> But I pray ſee what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion he hath in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 8. <hi>And God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is able to make all grace abound towards you, that ye always having all ſufficiency in all things. All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency</hi> is a great attribute of God: they have it in a kinde; <hi>That ye always having all ſufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work.</hi> Mark what great things he lays here before them. And if you look into chap. 6. of the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> verſ. 6. you ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll finde that the Apoſtle gives this plain direction that now I am upon for our growing in grace, and perfecting holineſs in the fear of God: <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go, on unto perfection, not laying again the foundation of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from dead works,</hi> &amp;c. Good people, mark: <hi>Let us go on to perfection:</hi> how? <hi>not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works.</hi> Some there are that are always laying the foundation, and all their life they are queſtioning whether their work were right at the firſt or no: Oh I am afraid I was never truly humbled at the firſt: their whole life is nothing but a laying of the foundation-work: why ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Let us go on to perfection,</hi> &amp;c. Be not always in this work of laying the foundation, if you would go on to perfection. And as for my ſelf, ſaith he, I go this way to work, as you may read in chap. 3. of this Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians: Brethren, I count not my ſelf to have apprehended, but this one thing: forgetting thoſe things which are behinde, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:45432:13"/>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ds the mark.</hi> Mark, it's a ſimilitude taken from thoſe that run in a Race: ſaith he, I do as thoſe that run in a Race; they ſtretch out their bodies towards the Price, ſo do I: and, ſaith he, as it is with thoſe that run in a Race, they do not go backward for to meaſure the ground that they have gone over, but they forget what is paſt, and preſs on to that which is before: ſo now do I, I forget that which is paſt, not onely ſo as not to reſt upon it, but I forget what is paſt, I am not always laying the foundation of the doctrine of repentance from dead works, but I preſs on to that which is before. And ſo, would you be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and would you grow, let your eyes be upon thoſe things that are before.</p>
               <p>Again, if you would grow in grace, cut off all thoſe ſuperfluities that grow out of your heart, and give up your ſelves wholly to the Word of the Lord in this world. If you would have a tree grow, you ſlip off the leſſer ſprigs that grow out of the ſides; they will hinder the growth, you will ſay: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>Wherefore lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide all filthineſs, and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs, receive with weekneſs the ingrafted word, which is able to ſave your ſouls.</hi> James 1. 21.</p>
               <p>But again, if you would grow in grace, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound yet more and more; obſerve what gifts or graces God hath given you, and labour to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them. Beloved, God doth give ſome gift or ſpecial grace to every Chriſtian, and that gift or grace is as a Spade or Shovel to dig out more out of the Mines of Chriſt. Every bird hath its bill, and by the bill it doth take in its meat, whereby it grows; and every Chriſtian hath one
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45432:13"/> gift or another whereby he doth excel: and with that gift or grace you ſhould now go unto Jeſus Chriſt, who is the great Ordinance, and fetch out more. Obſerve, I ſay, what that gift and grace is, and labour to improve it more and more.</p>
               <p>I will ſay no more in this; but if you would grow in grace, ſtudie much of the love of Jeſus Chriſt: and you ſhall finde that theſe two are put together by the Apoſtle, in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. <hi>For this cauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſus Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that he would grant you, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the riches of his glory, to be ſtrengthned with might by his Spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye being root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all Saints what is the bredth, and length, and depth, and hight, and to know the love of Christ which paſſeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulneſs of God.</hi> Mark how theſe go together: the more you ſee the love of Chriſt, the more you will love God; and the more you love him, the more you will obey him, and the more abundant you will be in the work of the Lord. Therefore as ye deſire to grow, ſtudy the free love of God in Jeſus Chriſt, and hereby you will be able to grow and to abound yet more and more. And that you may do it, give me leave to ſpeak here a little by way of encouragement hereunto, and ſo I will winde up all.</p>
               <p>Beloved in the Lord, when you hear of Gods bleſſing any in Scripture, he ſaith, <hi>Increaſe and multiply.</hi> So then, the more you do increaſe in grace, the more your gifts and graces multiply, the more you do carry up and down with you a teſtimony of the Lords bleſſing upon you.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:45432:14"/>
               <p> Beſides, herein you glorifie God the Father: <hi>Herein is my Father glorified,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>in that ye bring forth much fruit.</hi> 'Tis the glory of the husband-man, that the tree bring forth much; 'tis the glory of God the Father that ye bring forth much, that ye abound more and more.</p>
               <p>And the more and greater our opportunities are, and means of growth, the more are we all encouraged for to grow in grace. Let me appeal to you a little; have not your opportunities and means for growth been great here?</p>
               <p>Communion of Saints it is a great means for to grow in grace. Here you have time, here ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Saints meet together; and in poor Country-towns, poſſibly a poor Chriſtian may travel three or four miles before he can meet with one that may refreſh his thoughts: here you have the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities which you have not in other places. Communion of Saints, ſtanding in the courts of the houſe of the Lord, is a great means for to grow in grace.</p>
               <p>Preaching of the Goſpel, and the Word of Gods grace, is a ſpecial and great means of growth: it's call'd the rain of plenty, or the plentiful rain. It is a true ſpeech, <hi>It is the year, and not the ſoyl, that doth make the fruit:</hi> if the rain falls ſeaſonably, and the ſun ſhines ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, then you have fruit. Now Beloved, I appeal to you; have you not had a fine time of it here? have you not had a ſweet ſeaſon of Goſpel-prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching amongſt you? The Lord knows what plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful rain hath fallen upon you: Oh, great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements are upon you all for to grow in grace; and if you, this people, ſhall not after all your engagements this way, and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

We read of him that had but one talent, he wrapt it up in a napkin; but the Parable ſpeaks there wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Beloved, you have not had the one talent, you have not had the two talents: you have had the five talents: and if there was ſuch a miſerable end of him that wrapt up his one talent, O what will become of us that have five talents, and wrap them up, and do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them! You know what the Lord Chriſt ſaid to the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> how he threatned that Church: <hi>I have ſomewhat against thee, becauſe thou hast lost thy firſt love: remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works, or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candleſtick out of his place.</hi> God knows whether your firſt love be not left, or no; I am ſure the Lord hath taken away a burning and a ſhining light from among you; and certainly, if you do not grow and thrive under all thoſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of grace, and growth in grace that you have had, and ſtill have; how ſoon the Lord may quite remove his Candleſtick from you, and leave you quite in the dark, he onely knows. Wherefore, Beloved in the Lord, you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved much, Oh much is expected from you, much
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45432:15"/> is expected from you. And let me tell you for your encouragement, If you do grow in grace, and abound in the work of the Lord, then ſhall there be <hi>an abundant entrance given unto you into the everlasting inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo I come to that place of <hi>Peter,</hi> which I ſhall but open before you, and ſo have done for this time; and I pray conſider it diligently. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>And beſides this, giving all diligence, add to your faith vertue, and to vertue knowledge.</hi> But mark how he prefaces before he comes to the words: <hi>Whereby</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are given unto us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and pretious promiſes, that by theſe you might be partakers of the divine nature, having eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the corruption that is in the world through lusts.</hi> Now beſides this, there is ſomething elſe to be done: well, what's that? it is ſuch a matter, as all diligence is to be given to it: <hi>Beſides this, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all diligence, adde to your faith vertue.</hi> 'Tis not, 'tis not enough that you believe, but you muſt have moral vertue alſo: <hi>Adde unto your faith vertue.</hi> I but ſuppoſe we have moral vertue, is not that enough?

But ſuppoſe we have that, is not that enough? no; <hi>adde charity:</hi> brotherly kindneſs may be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you that are brethren, but there muſt be charity towards all, to thoſe that are not of the body. Well, but ſuppoſe we do theſe things, what then? Read verſ 8. <hi>For if theſe things be in you and abound, they make you that ye ſhall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> You complain that your hearts are barren, and that you lie as barren ground in the Family: why if you would not be barren and unfruitful, you muſt grow, and adde one grace unto another; <hi>And if theſe things be in you and abound, they make you that ye ſhall neither be barren nor unfruitful.</hi> Well, but ſuppoſe a man lack theſe things; read verſ 9. <hi>But he that lacketh theſe things is blinde, and cannot ſee afar off:</hi> he may ſee ſome things in Religion that are neer, but thoſe things that are afar off he is blinde in them, <hi>and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old ſins,</hi> that is, by Baptiſm. But ſuppoſe we do all this, what then?

                  <hi>last ſhall be firſt.</hi> Which being ſpoken in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto ſuffering, and forſaking of our world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſt for the Name of Chriſt; the Doctrine then is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That many that are first ſhall be laſt, and many that are last ſhall be firſt, in ſuffering-work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the clearing whereof, there were four things propounded.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, what it is for a man to be <hi>firſt that is last,</hi> and to be <hi>last that is first.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, how it may <hi>appear</hi> that many that are firſt ſhall be laſt, and many that are laſt ſhall be firſt in ſuffering-work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>how</hi> and <hi>in what reſpect</hi> that is true.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fourthly, what are the <hi>Reaſons</hi> on't.</p>
               <p>And then the <hi>Application.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, what is it for <hi>one that is firſt to be last,</hi> and <hi>one that is last to be firſt?</hi> what's this?</p>
               <p>Some think this is to be underſtood in regard of the ſameneſs of reward; as if Chriſt had ſaid thus: The firſt ſhall be as the laſt, and the laſt ſhall be as the firſt, in matter of reward. And for this, they have the next Parable to ſhew, where this ſame ſpeech is brought in: <hi>A certain houſholder went out early in the morning to hire la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers into his vineyard, and agreed with the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers for a peny a day: and be hired ſome at the first hour, and ſome at the laſt; and thoſe that came in at the last, received a peny as the firſt did.</hi> Whereupon the firſt they grumbled. The Maſter anſwered, verſ. 15. <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? is thine eye evil, becauſe I am good? So the last ſhall be firſt, and the firſt last.</hi> Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the laſt had the ſame peny. As if the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this therefore ſhould be thus much, That
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45432:18"/> there ſhould be the ſame reward given to the one as to the other. But this cannot be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on't: for it is not true; for there ſhall not be the ſame reward given to all; ſome ſhall have more then others, ſome ſhall have greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of glory then others.</p>
               <p>If there be degrees of torments in hell, then there are degrees of glory in heaven. There are degrees of torment in hell; for Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>He that knoweth his Maſters will, and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with MANY ſtripes,</hi> with <hi>more</hi> ſtripes then thoſe that are <hi>ignorant,</hi> and know it not. Now if there be degrees of torment in hell, there are degrees of glory in heaven: and therefore the thing is not true, That there ſhall be the <hi>ſame</hi> reward.</p>
               <p>And here in chap. 19. we ſee, that the Apoſtles are ſet higher in their reward: <hi>When the Son of man ſhall ſit in the throne of his glory, YE alſo ſhall ſit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And our Saviour Chriſt here, he doth not ſpeak univerſally, nor indefinitely: he doth not ſay that ALL that are firſt ſhall be laſt, and ALL that are laſt ſhall be firſt; neither doth he ſpeak defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, The firſt ſhall be laſt, and the laſt firſt: but he ſpeaks thus, <hi>That MANY that are first;</hi> he doth not ſay <hi>ALL that are firſt ſhall be last;</hi> neither doth he ſay indefinitely, <hi>The firſt ſhall be last,</hi> but, <hi>MANY that are firſt ſhall be last, and the last ſhall be firſt.</hi> That's the meaning then.</p>
               <p>Others think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>herefore the meaning is this, and the words are to be underſtood in reference to mens conceit and opinion: as if he ſhould ſay, Be not conceited; for though ye ſuffer much, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45432:19"/> forſake a great deal for me, and for my Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, yet many that are firſt in their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, ſhall be laſt; and many that are laſt in their own opinion and conceit, ſhall be firſt. This is true; but this is not all the meaning.</p>
               <p>Therefore we muſt know, that a <hi>perſon</hi> or <hi>thing</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>last,</hi> in regard of <hi>time,</hi> or in regard of <hi>dignity</hi> or <hi>chiefdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In regard of <hi>time:</hi> ſo we ſay the laſt day is the firſt day of the week; firſt, in regard of <hi>time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, in regard of <hi>chiefdom;</hi> and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whereof I am chief.</hi> In the Original it is, <hi>This is a true ſaying, that Christ came into the world to ſave ſinners, whereof I am the FIRST;</hi> but we read it <hi>chief,</hi> becauſe the <hi>chief</hi> is the <hi>firſt. Firſt</hi> is put for <hi>chief</hi> in Scripture-language: and ſo 'tis true, <hi>many,</hi> many that are firſt in religion, ancient profeſſors, ſhall be laſt at ſuffering for the Name of Chriſt, when it comes to 't; and many that are laſt in religion, novices in religion, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought in, ſhall be the firſt in ſuffering for the Cauſe, and for the Name of Jeſus Chriſt. And ſo, many that are chief, and of great eſteem in the world, that are firſt in eſteem, ſhall be laſt at ſuffering-work; and many that are laſt in eſteem, and of no account, ſhall be firſt to ſuffer for the Name of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a thing is ſaid to <hi>be</hi> in Scripture, when 'tis declared to be, when it appears to be. So in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. ſpeaking concerning the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt, <hi>According as it is written, This day have I begotten thee.</hi> Why <hi>this day</hi> have I begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thee? why was Chriſt begotten that day, the day of his reſurrection? Chriſt was the eternal Son of God: how is this, <hi>This day have I bogotten</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:45432:19"/> 
                  <hi>thee,</hi> to prove the reſurrection? The Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. by the reſurrection he was <hi>mightily DECLARED to be the Son of God.</hi> So that in Scripture-phraſe, a thing is ſaid to <hi>be,</hi> when it is <hi>declar'd to be,</hi> and <hi>appears</hi> to be. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly now, many that are firſt, that appear to be firſt, ſhall in due time appear to be laſt in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering-work; and many that appear to be laſt, ſhall in due time appear to be firſt in ſuffering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work for the Cauſe of Chriſt, and for the Name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus now in the general we hear what this means: more particularly afterwards.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, how may it <hi>appear</hi> that many that are firſt ſhall be laſt, and many that are laſt ſhall be firſt in ſuffering-work, ſuffering for the Name of Chriſt? (For I am not now ſpeaking of the thing at large, that many that are firſt ſhall be laſt, and many that are laſt ſhall be firſt, in the general, but in reference onely to ſuffering.) How may that appear? Thus:</p>
               <p>'Tis in the <hi>ſuffering</hi> part of Religion, as in the <hi>doing</hi> part. In the <hi>doing</hi> part of Religion, many that are firſt ſhall be laſt: many that are great men in duty, and of great abilities and gifts, ſhall be laſt; and many that are laſt, and weak and low in grace, that you would think had no grace at all, ſhall be firſt. 'Tis ſaid ſo in the next Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, in the Parable: there 'tis ſpoken in regard of <hi>doing;</hi> here in this Scripture 'tis ſpoken in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of <hi>ſuffering.</hi> Now in regard of <hi>doing,</hi> ſo it is (I ſay).</p>
               <p>Is it not a great matter for a man to frequent the Ordinances with delight; to believe, and to repent, and to preach, and to propheſie, and do
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45432:20"/> many wonderful works, caſting out devils in the Name of Chriſt? All theſe things in ſome ſenſe a man may do, and yet may fall ſhort of heaven.</p>
               <p>Poſſibly a man may attend upon the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with delight. In <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58. <hi>Ye delight in approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to me,</hi> ye unſound, hypocrites.</p>
               <p>Poſſibly a man may in ſome meaſure <hi>believe,</hi> and yet be unſound. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> that <hi>he himſelf alſo believed,</hi> in the <hi>Acts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Poſſibly a man may <hi>repent</hi> in ſome ſenſe, and yet be unſound. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Judas,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. when he ſaw what became of Chriſt, <hi>he repented himſelf, and carried the money again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. they ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy Name, and cast out devils in thy Name, and done many wonderful works in thy Name?</hi> And yet Chriſt ſhall ſay at laſt, <hi>Depart, I never knew you.</hi> So that many men go very far in the <hi>doing</hi> part of Religion, and yet fall ſhort of heaven. If then, the firſt may be laſt in the <hi>doing</hi> part of Religion, why ſhould it be a thing incredible to us, that the firſt may be laſt in the <hi>ſuffering</hi> part?</p>
               <p>The ſecond demonſtration of it, to clear it, is this:</p>
               <p>If a man may ſpoil and loſe all his former ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings by his after-ſins; and if a man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, repair, recompence his former backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſuffer, by his after-faith and grace; then preſently the laſt may be firſt, and the firſt may be laſt in point of ſuffering. So it is.</p>
               <p>Poſſibly a man may loſe all his former-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by his after-ſins: <hi>Fooliſh Galatians!</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>have ye ſuffered ſo many things in vain, if yet in vain?</hi> They fell from the doctrine of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45432:20"/> grace, to juſtification by works; and they loſt all their ſufferings by their after-ſins.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was very back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to come to Chriſt; he <hi>came by n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ght;</hi> he was afraid to ſuffer: yet afterwards, when Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he owned Chriſt openly: and the Holy-ghoſt ſets a mark upon it, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. <hi>This is that Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus which came to Jeſus by night.</hi> He did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence his former backwardneſs to ſuffer, by his after-faith. So that a man may loſe his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſufferings by his after-ſins; and a man may recover and recompence his former backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſufferings, by his after-faith and grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If a man may be a famous Preacher of the Goſpel, and loſe much upon that account, and yet prove an Apoſtate, a perſecutor of the Goſpel; and if a man may be a notorious perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of the Goſpel, and yet afterwards prove a famous Preacher of the Goſpel, and ſuffer much upon that account: Then poſſibly the firſt may be laſt, and the laſt may be firſt in point of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering So it is, that a man may be a famous Preacher of the Goſpel, and loſe much upon that account; and yet afterwards prove an Apoſtate, a perſecutor. So it was with <hi>Judas.</hi> When Chriſt ſent forth his diſciples, ſaying, <hi>Take no purſe, nor ſcrip,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Judas</hi> was among them, and left his purſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and was no doubt a famous Miniſter; yet after, he became a moſt notorious perſecutor, and headed the party that came to take Jeſus.</p>
               <p>And always (as you may obſerve) the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are headed with ſome Apoſtate; they have ſome Apoſtate in the head of them.</p>
               <p>And on the other ſide, who doth not know what a notorious perſecutor <hi>Paul</hi> was! inſomuch
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45432:21"/> as he ſaith upon that ſcore, that he was <hi>the least of all the Apoſtles, becauſe he perſecuted the Church of God:</hi> and yet who doth not know what a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Preacher of the Goſpel he was, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much upon that ſcore! So then, the thing lies clear and plain, That poſſibly the laſt may be firſt, and the firſt may be laſt, in point of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>How</hi> and <hi>in what reſpect</hi> is this true?</p>
               <p>Firſt, it's true in regard of priviledges and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments: many that are firſt in regard of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and enjoyments, ſhall be laſt at the work of ſuffering for Chriſt; and many that are laſt in priviledges and enjoyments, ſhall be firſt in the work of ſuffering for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Many that are firſt in priviledges and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhall be laſt in ſuffering. Here's a young man comes to Chriſt, <hi>and Christ loved him;</hi> and he ſaith unto Chriſt, <hi>What ſhall I do</hi> 10 <hi>inherit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life? Keep the commandments,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. <hi>I have done it,</hi> ſaith he. I but ſaith Chriſt, <hi>One thing thou lackest; go ſell what thou haſt, and give to the poor, and come and follow me, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven.</hi> And ſaith the text, <hi>He went away ſorrowful, for he had a great eſtate;</hi> he was rich, he was a priviledged man, and he had great enjoyments, for he was a rich man; and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he was the moſt backward for to leave all for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, <hi>the poor receive the Goſpel:</hi> and as the poor do <hi>receive</hi> the Goſpel, ſo they <hi>hold</hi> it, and <hi>keep</hi> it, and <hi>ſuffer</hi> for it. So that 'tis true then in regard of priviledges and enjoyments.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this is true in regard of abilities: many that are firſt in regard of ability, ſhall be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45432:21"/> laſt in ſuffering for Chriſt; and many that are laſt in abilities, ſhall be firſt in ſuffering for the Name of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Many that are firſt in Abilities: ſo the diſciples, when Chriſt ſaid to them, <hi>Are ye able to drink of the cup that I am to drink of?</hi> and <hi>are ye able to be baptized with the baptiſm that I am to be baptized with? Yea Lord</hi> (ſay they) <hi>we are able.</hi> But when Chriſt came to ſuffer, 'tis ſaid, <hi>They all forſook him and fled.</hi> Firſt, in point of abilities; and laſt, in point of ſuffering. But <hi>Mary,</hi> and a company of <hi>weak women,</hi> cleaved unto Chriſt, and followed him to the very laſt: the firſt were laſt, and the laſt were firſt. And look into the Book of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs: where do you finde the Martyrs growing? do you finde them growing upon Univerſities? Few were Scholars and Doctors that were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, but growing in Country-towns and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. So 'tis ſaid of <hi>Origen,</hi> that when he was a young man, about ſixteen or ſeventeen years old, his mother was forc'd to hide his very Shift from him, ſo that he was aſhamed to go into the ſtreets; for otherwiſe he would have gone to have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd Martyrdom. But afterwards, when he came to be a great Doctor, then he offered to the Idols; inſomuch as they cryed out, <hi>Origen hath ſacrificed!</hi> While he was weak and young, very forward to ſuffer: when he was grown ſtrong, and had abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, then backward. <hi>The last ſhall be first, and the firſt ſhall be last.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, this is true alſo in regard of <hi>action,</hi> profeſſional action. Many that are firſt in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and of great performance, ſhall be laſt in ſuffering for the Name of Chriſt. And many that have not been of ſo great profeſſion, and ſuch
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45432:22"/> high performance, ſhall ſuffer when it comes to it; they ſhall ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt. You have an inſtance in the Parable of the ſtony ground; it <hi>receives the Word with joy:</hi> yet notwithſtanding, <hi>when tribulation and perſecution ariſe becauſe of the Word, by and by they are offended.</hi> So they were high, and firſt in profeſſion, yea action too, and yet the laſt in ſuffering.</p>
               <p>So on the other ſide, you know the ſtories there that go together: a certain man comes to Chriſt, and ſaith, <hi>Lord, I will follow thee whitherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou goest.</hi> Saith Chriſt, <hi>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man hath not whereon to lay his head.</hi> Then Chriſt comes to another, and ſaith to him, <hi>Follow me. Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I must go bury my father.</hi> Why <hi>let the dead bury their dead.</hi> What's the meaning of this, but to ſhew thus much, That <hi>the firſt ſhall be last, and the last ſhall be first,</hi> in forſaking their worldly intereſts for Chriſt, and for the Name of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this is true alſo in point of Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: many that are firſt in reſolving to ſuffer, ſhall be laſt to ſuffer when it comes to; and many that are laſt in reſolving, ſhall be firſt in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) though all men forſake thee, yet will not I.</hi> Bravely reſolved! but though he was firſt in the reſolve, yet he was firſt in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking Chriſt. <hi>The cock ſhall not crow before thou deny me.</hi> And you know how it was with thoſe <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pendleton</hi> and <hi>Sanders.</hi>
                  </note> two in the Book of Martyrs: the one was a very fat man, and he would burn, his greaſe ſhould fry in the fire for the Name of Chriſt: the other was a lean man, and he cries out, <hi>Oh I am afraid I ſhall never hold out!</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:45432:22"/> But when it came to, the lean man was the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, and the fat man would not burn. So that that is true in the point of Reſolution.</p>
               <p>And true it is alſo in the point of Indurance and pain in the work of ſuffering. And in that, many that are firſt in the work of ſuffering, ſhall be laſt in the reward; and many that are laſt in the work of ſuffering, ſhall be firſt in the reward. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. <hi>Though I give all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burnt, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> Poſſibly a man may give his goods to the poor, part with his worldly intereſt to the poor, and give his body to be burnt, and yet want <hi>love.</hi> So then, the firſt in the very work of ſuffering, may be laſt in the reward: 'tis true in that reſpect. And ſo I have done with that.</p>
               <p>But then in the fourth place, what's the reaſon of this, and how comes this to paſs, that many that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re firſt ſhall be laſt, and many that are laſt ſhall be firſt in ſuffering-work? There are two Reaſons for it.</p>
               <p>The firſt is drawn from God and his grace.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is drawn from our ſelves and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
               <p>The firſt is drawn from God and his grace, thus: 'Tis Gods ordinary way in his dealings with his creatures, to ſet thoſe things and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before, that do ſtand behinde; and thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, that do ſtand before. As in Printing, you don't take the letters and place that firſt that is firſt in the Alphabet, but that which is firſt in the Word; as in <hi>zeal, z</hi> is the firſt, but it's the laſt in the Alphabet. And ſo God in writing down the names of men in the Book of life, he writes
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45432:23"/> down them that ſtand behinde; the laſt letter firſt, and the firſt letter laſt. See it for inſtance.</p>
               <p>When the Lord had to deal with Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which was the firſt in the Creation? The Angels they were the elder brother to Man, they ſtood firſt: but when Men and Angels had fallen, God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e redeems Man, and ſets him before, that ſtood behinde; and takes the fallen Angels, and ſets them behinde, that were firſt in the Creation; ſets them behinde, and Man that was behinde, he is brought before. So when God would take a people to himſelf, what people did God take to be <hi>his people?</hi> A poor, forlorn, deſpiſed people, The people of the Jews; and paſt over all the glorious Nations of the world.</p>
               <p>And when God would take a family out of that people, what family did he take? The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſe.</hi> And when he would take a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon, what perſon was it? <hi>David</hi> the younger brother, that ſtood behinde, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſheep: he that ſtood behind was brought before, and he that ſtood before was ſet behind. That for the time of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>So in the time of the N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And what Nation did God take out of the Gentiles? did he take any great continent in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45432:23"/> 
                  <hi>America,</hi> where the Gold and the Silver is? No, but <hi>the Iſles ſhall wait for thy law:</hi> and, <hi>the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Kedar ſhall rejoyce,</hi> and <hi>the inhabitants of the rocks ſhall ſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when God would convert theſe, whom did he make uſe of to do it? He makes uſe of <hi>Paul, Paul</hi> the <hi>last</hi> of all the Apoſtles: the twelve Apoſtles they ſtood firſt: but he that ſtood behind, that was brought in laſt, that was <hi>born out of time,</hi> he is taken to do the work.</p>
               <p>And who are they that are converted to him? They are <hi>babes</hi> and <hi>ſucklings:</hi> not <hi>many wiſe,</hi> not <hi>many noble,</hi> but <hi>habes</hi> and <hi>ſucklings. Even ſo, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe thou art ſo pleaſed.</hi> This is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of God: he takes thoſe things that ſtand behind, and brings them before; and takes thoſe things that ſtand before, and ſets them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. And why doth he do ſo? Why</p>
               <p>Becauſe <hi>he will ſhew mercy to whom he will ſhew mercy:</hi> whom he will, he ſhews mercy unto; and <hi>whom he will he hardens:</hi> and he orders things in ſuch a way, <hi>that no fleſh may glory.</hi> 1 Cor. 1. <hi>But God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world, to confound the wiſe; and God hath choſen the weak things of the world, to confound the things which are mighty; and baſe things of the world, and things which are deſpiſed, hath God choſen; yea and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are.</hi> Why? <hi>That no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence,</hi> v. 29. God will carry things in ſuch a way, as no fleſh may glory, either in their doings, or in their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. And how will he order it then? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the firſt ſhall be last, and the last ſhall be firſt,</hi> both in <hi>doing,</hi> and in <hi>ſuffering;</hi> that no fleſh may glory, but that grace may be all in all. Whom
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45432:24"/> he will he ſhews mercy to, and whom he will he hardens. This is the firſt Reaſon, drawn from God himſelf, and from his grace.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon is drawn from our ſelves, and from our ſufferings; and it lies thus:</p>
               <p>If there be a great deal of ſuffering that will come to little; and if there be a little ſuffering that will amount to much, and come to much: then <hi>many that are last ſhall be firſt, and the firſt ſhall be last,</hi> in point of ſuffering.</p>
               <p>Now ſo it is, that there is a great deal of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering which will come to little, come to little account. <hi>Judas left all;</hi> and it came to little. <hi>Alexander</hi> drawn out of the croud in ſuffering for Chriſt, and it came to little: <hi>Alexander the copperſmith did me much evil; the Lord reward him according to his works.</hi> His ſufferings came to little. The poor Chriſtians that are taken ſlaves by the Turks, they lie in ſlavery ten years together, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they will renounce the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: yet when they come out, O what drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, and ſwearers, and enemies to God, and ſuch as have nothing of Chriſt in them! O they ſuffer much, but it comes to little; they ſhall not be ſav'd. So that I ſay there is a great deal of ſuffering that will come to little.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, there is a little ſuffering that will amount to much. A cup of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall have its reward; the mite that the poor woman gave, more then all the reſt, ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. 'Twas no great matter that <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> ſuffered for <hi>Paul:</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, On<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſiphorus was not aſhamed of my chains; he ſought me out diligently, and oft refreſhed my bowels. The Lord ſhew mercy to the houſhold of Oneſiphorus.</hi> It was no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45432:24"/> that he ſuffered, but it did amount to much.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, How can this be, that there ſhould be a great deal of ſuffering that will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to little, and a little ſuffering that will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to much?</p>
               <p>Both ways I anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if you ask how it can be that a great deal of ſufferings ſhould come to little;</p>
               <p>I anſwer firſt, 'tis poſſible that a man may loſe, that he may gain. I am a Miniſter, and have a Living; and I may loſe my Living poſſibly, that I may get a livelihood another way. I may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and go to priſon, that I may be maintain'd. I do not reflect upon any particular, but only to ſhew the deceitfulneſs of our hearts in ſuch a caſe.</p>
               <p>And who doth not know, that a man may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from a natural boldneſs and courage? and that he may ſuffer by crouding in among good people that are in a ſuffering way?</p>
               <p>And who doth not know, that a man may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon the ſtrength of education? As a Turk, a Jew, a Papiſt, a Proteſtant, may ſuffer in the Religion that they are educated and brought up in.</p>
               <p>And who knows not that a man may ſuffer ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much in a way of merit? It's recorded of one, that he invited a friend of his to dinner, that ſo he might ſhew unto him his Hounds. And when he came, he ſhewed unto him a company of poor people, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Theſe are my Hounds with which I do hunt for heaven.</hi> In a way of merit he ſpeaks. And we ſee how it is with a Horſe or a Cow in paſture that's eaten down; if
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45432:25"/> there be herbs or pleaſant flowers growing in the ditch that's full of water, the Horſa or Cow will reach, and reach many times ſo far, that it falls into the ditch. Truly there are many fine flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers grow in the ſuffering ditch, and many an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound heart may reach ſo far, till it falls into the ditch. As it's poſſible that a man may tread a great deal of ground, and never come to his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end: ſo 'tis poſſible a man may tread a great deal of ſuffering ground, and never come to heaven; for there's a great deal of droſs cleaving to our beſt ſufferings.</p>
               <p>In a ſuffering time, then we are apt to be very froward, and to be impatient, and to dwell more upon our own pleaſures then upon Gods diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in ſuffering times, then we are very apt to forget our former experiences, and to be unthankful for our preſent mercies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in ſuffering times we are very apt to boggle at the diſpenſation, to fall foul upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> to complain of Gods dealings with us, and not of our own unworthy dealings with God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in ſuffering times we are very apt to look to the ſmart of our ſufferings, and not to the cauſe; or elſe to pitch upon the wrong cauſe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, in ſuffering times we are very apt to wiſh that we had never begun in the work of God; As <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Elders, when they ſmarted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the men of <hi>Ai: Would to God we had ſtayed on the other ſide Jordan,</hi> (ſay they.) So when men meet with the ſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rt of afflictions in the way and work of God, O then, would to God we had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meddled with the work of Reformation;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45432:25"/> would to God we had been content with our leeks and onions which we had before.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, in ſuffering times we are very apt to comply and correſpond with our enemies, and with Gods enemies; and to uſe unworthy ſhifts to get out of trouble: as <hi>Abraham</hi> did; <hi>Say, thou art my ſiſter.</hi> 'Tis true, ſhe was his ſiſter; but ſhe was his wife: and it was an unworthy ſhift for ſuch a man as <hi>Abraham</hi> was.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, in ſuffering times we are very apt to tempt the Lord, and to <hi>limit the holy One of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi> and to ſay, <hi>Can God provide a table now?</hi> Can God provide a table for me in this wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Thus there's a great deal of droſs cleaves to all our ſufferings, and therefore no wonder that a great deal of ſuffering comes to little.</p>
               <p>And on the other ſide, that a little ſuffering may amount to much. I can give no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it but this; God hath a very gracious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for his people. As we uſe to ſay; We bear with children when it is their weaning time. Truly our ſuffering-time is our weaning-time: And God ſaith, Bear with ſuch a one, 'tis his weaning-time. <hi>You have beard of the patience of Job.</hi> Why I have heard of <hi>Jobs</hi> impatience. True; but God did not meaſure <hi>Job</hi> in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> wallops, but when he was cold. As we do not meaſure milk when it wallops and ſeethes, but when it's cold: ſo God doth not meaſure <hi>Job</hi> in his paſſion, but when he was off the fire, when he was cool. You ſay, the beſt Gold muſt have its allowance; if it want a Grain or two, it muſt have its allowance. So all the ſuffering people of God muſt have their allowance: and God hath a very great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for his ſuffering people; and therefore
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45432:26"/> this is all the reaſon that I can give, why a little ſuffering ſhall go a great way. So then, put all together, and you have the Doctrine clear'd in all the particulars of it.</p>
               <p>If many that are firſt ſhall be laſt in point of ſuffering, why then ſhould we not all take heed how we ſuffer, look to the manner of our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, look to our hearts in ſuffering? He's a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man, that doth <hi>what</hi> he ſhould, <hi>as</hi> he ſhould. So he's not a true ſufferer, that ſuffers <hi>what</hi> he ſhould, but that ſuffers <hi>what</hi> he ſhould, <hi>as</hi> he ſhould. When we hear how far a man may go in Religion, and yet be unſound, and go to hell; then we ſhould ſay, Good Lord, I will then look to my heart in prayer, and look to my heart in duty. So in point of ſuffering, if many that are firſt ſhall be laſt, and the laſt firſt; then I will look to my heart in ſuffering, if ever I be called to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if that many that are firſt ſhall be laſt in ſuffering-work, why then ſhould we not walk humbly under all our ſufferings? <hi>The firſt ſhall be last, and the last ſhall be firſt.</hi> A man who hath prayed a prayer, or performed a duty, he ſhould do as one that hath written a Letter; why he will read over the Letter, and then he mends it, and then he looks over the letter, and throws duſt, duſt, duſt upon the Letter. And ſo a man when he hath performed any duty, he ſhould look over his duty, and throw <hi>dust,</hi> I mean hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and ſelf-denial, upon his duties. So ſhould we do in regard of our ſufferings; if ever we be call'd to ſuffer, read over our ſufferings, and throw duſt upon our ſufferings, walk humbly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45432:26"/> under them: for <hi>many that are firſt ſhall be last</hi> in point of ſuffering.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, why ſhould we reſt in what we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and not preſs on to that which lies before? The life of a Chriſtian is like the life of a man in a Cooks ſhop, from one work to another. Like the life of a Husbandman; he plows and he har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and he ſowes and reaps, and threſhes; and he never ſtands ſtill. So the life of a Chriſtian, always at work. You know what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>If any man will be my diſciple, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs.</hi> What then? take a ſtool and ſit down? No, <hi>let him take up his croſs and follow me.</hi> Follow me after ſufferings, not ſit down and reſt there. When we have done all, ſtill preſs on to that which is before.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if many that are firſt ſhall be laſt in point of ſuffering, why ſhould we not take heed that we don't give in if ever we be called to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering? As it is ſaid of the French, <hi>They are fire at the firſt onſet, but ſmoke in the iſſue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So there are many that are rare men at a Charge, and they overcome in a Skirmiſh; but they give in at the Battel. But is this true, that many that are firſt in ſuffering, ſhall be laſt? Oh then why ſhould we not take heed that we don't give in if we be call'd to ſuffering?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, if this be true alſo, that many that are laſt, ſhall be firſt in the work of ſuffering; why ſhould we cenſure or deſpiſe ſome that are weak, that do drag, that do come behinde, that are backward (as we think) unto the work of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering? We will not blame an Apple-tree or a Pear-tree that is winter-fruit, becauſe it doth not come ſo ſoon as other trees that are ſummer-fruit?
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45432:27"/> So there are ſome men that are ſooner ripe for ſufferings, and they are ſummer-fruit; others that are backward, and they are winter-fruit, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on't come ſo ſoon. The Lord hath many guſts of ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rings, and ſuch a one may be reſerved for the ſecond, or for the third part. Now as we do not blame the tree for bringing forth ſo late, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a winter-fruit: ſo why ſhould we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe ſome that are backward in our eyes, that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng and flag as to the buſineſs of ſuffering? why <hi>the firſt ſhall be last, and the last ſhall be firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, why ſhould any be afraid, or be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, becauſe they are weak, and unfit to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer? As <hi>many that are firſt ſhall be last,</hi> ſo, <hi>many that are last ſhall be firſt.</hi> As there is a great deal of ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ring that will come to a little, ſo there is a little ſuffering that will amount to much. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though you be unfit (as you think) for this ſuffering work, yet be not diſcouraged.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, I am not afraid of ſuffering upon this account, but I am afraid of my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing becauſe of my ſin: for now ſuffering times are come, and we ſuffer for our ſins; and can any ſuffering that comes by ſin, turn to a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? If I did know that my ſuffering ſhould turn to a good account, I would never be afraid to ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r: but I fear my ſuffering will not turn to a good account, becauſe my ſufferings come by ſin. Can any ſufferings that come by ſin turn to a good account?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Yea, through the grace of God. When the Ark was taken, were not the people in a ſad condition? Yes; <hi>they lamented after the Ark twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years.</hi> And did not that condition come by their ſin? Yes. Did that turn to any good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45432:27"/> Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: for <hi>Dagon</hi> falls down before the Ark: the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> own hands brought it home again; and they give glory to God. So that it turned to a good account.</p>
               <p>But eſpecially that inſtance of <hi>David.</hi> There was a Peſtilence, and many thouſands died: and did it come by ſin? Yes; <hi>David numbers the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> I, but did it turn to any good account? Yes: for then the Lord told <hi>David</hi> where his Temple ſhould be built, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. 1. David had a great deſire to know where Gods houſe ſhould be built; but never was it told till now. So that thus this ſuffering turned to a good account, although it came by ſin. Poſſibly a ſuffering may come by ſin, and yet (through grace) it may turn to a good account.</p>
               <p>But then the great Queſtion of all is, ſuppoſe thus: Suppoſe there be ſuch a great reward laid out for thoſe that ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt: ſuppoſe there is a great deal of ſuffering will turn to a little account; ſuppoſe there is a little ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering will turn to a great account: How ſhall I ſo order and manage my ſufferings, as that my ſufferings may turn to a good account? Indeed this is a great Queſtion, and worthy of all our conſideration.</p>
               <p>For anſwer unto this:</p>
               <p>Firſt, if you would order and manage all your ſufferings ſo as they may turn to a good account, be ſure of this, That all your ſufferings be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid with Godlineſs; <hi>Perſonal</hi> Godlineſs, and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual</hi> Godlineſs.</p>
               <p>With perſonal godlineſs: for if your perſon be not accepted, your ſuffering will not: if you be not in Chriſt, your ſuffering will come to little.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45432:28"/> As the tree is, ſo is the fruit that grows upon the tree: if the tree be a Crab, all the fruit is but Crabs. And if you be a Crab, and not implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Jeſus Chriſt, your ſuffering will not be accepted.</p>
               <p>And not onely perſonal godlineſs, but actual godlineſs; ſo as not to lie in any ſin, either of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or commiſſion. For any ſin is a hole in the bag of our ſufferings: if there be a hole in the bag, all your money will run out. Surely if a man lies in any ſin, that ſin is a hole in the bottom of the bag, and all the profits of his ſufferings will run out, though he ſuffers never ſo much for Chriſt, and for Religion. Therefore that's the firſt thing; be ſure that all your ſufferings be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid with godlineſs, perſonal and actual godlineſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if you would ſo order and manage your ſufferings, as that they may turn to a good account; then labour to get your underſtanding clear, and your will free, in the matter and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſufferings. For though the thing that you ſuffer for be never ſo right, yet if you have not a clear underſtanding in what you ſuffer, your ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering will turn to little. And though you have never ſo clear an underſtanding, yet if your will be not free, it will turn to little. You know how it was with <hi>Moſes;</hi> it 's ſaid, <hi>He refuſed to be call'd the ſon of Pharaohs daughter, and choſe rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer affliction with the people of God.</hi> Why when was this? <hi>when he came of years.</hi> Why when he came of years? Becauſe then he had diſcretion and underſtanding; and the Holy-ghoſt would ſhew, that he did what he did <hi>underſtandingly</hi> in the point of his ſuffering: and he did it <hi>freely</hi> in the point of his <hi>will;</hi> for he <hi>choſe rather:</hi> chuſing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45432:28"/> is an act of the <hi>will.</hi> So that if you would have your ſufferings turn to a good account, labour to get a clear underſtanding in the matter of your ſufferings, and be very free in your will.</p>
               <p>You will ſay to me, How can I be freely wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with my houſe, or land, or liberty?</p>
               <p>Yes, you may be very free, and freely willing to part with all in reference to the will of God your Father. Chriſt himſelf ſaid, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me.</hi> He was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in regard of the thing it ſelf he ſuffer'd: but he was very willing, in regard of the Fathers will; and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> This is the ſecond thing: let your underſtanding be clear, and your will be free in the matter of your ſufferings.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, take heed you run not into any ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering without a Call, nor ruſh out of that ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without the ſame Call from God. <hi>Noah</hi> was in the Ark; and when the waters were abated from off the earth, <hi>Noah</hi> would not ſtir out of the Ark. Why would not <hi>Noah</hi> go out when the waters were abated? Why as <hi>Noah</hi> had a Call to go in, ſo he would have the ſame Call to go out. A man muſt not run into a ſuffering with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Call, and he muſt not ruſh out of it without a Call. And therefore you ſhall finde Chriſt and the Apoſtles, and all the Martyrs, that thus they acted: they would hide, and go aſide, and avoid their ſufferings: but when they were in hold, they would not go out, though the doors were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. So that that's the third thing; be ſure of this, that you do not run into ſufferings without a Call, nor ruſh out of ſufferings without the ſame Call from God.</p>

               <p> Fourthly, if you would order and manage all your ſufferings ſo as they may turn to a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, then ſet all your loſſes upon Chriſts head, and upon Chriſts ſcore: which you may do, if you do ſuffer for Chriſts cauſe; which you may do, if you do ſuffer according to Chriſts example; which you may do, if you ſuffer with the ſame ſpirit and diſpoſition that Chriſt did, &amp; ſuffer in the ſtrength of Chriſt, ſet all upon the head &amp; ſcore of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, if you would ſo order and manage all your ſufferings as that they may turn to a good account, then take heed that there be no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction found in the way of your ſuffering. A man may be very ſtiff, and ſtand out here, and yet he may yeeld there. Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>If I build a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain what I have deſtroyed, I make my ſelf a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor.</hi> And, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that condemns not himſelf in the thing that he allows.</hi> 'Tis poſſible I may build that with one hand, that I may pull down with another. Poſſibly a man may be very ſtiff, and ſtand out at ſuch a thing, and yet he may yeeld there. There may be contradictions found in the way of our ſuffering. And let me tell you this, if it be thus, your ſufferings will come to little. Take heed that there be not contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therefore found in the way of your ſufferings.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, if you would manage your ſufferings ſo as they may turn to a good account, then let your eye be more upon the Publike good, then upon your own private loſs; more upon Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, then your own detriment; more upon Gods diſhonour, then your own grievance, or your own preſſure. 'Tis good for a man to be ſpiritual and ſavoury in his ſuffering: our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Such worſhippers the Father ſeeks,</hi> &amp;c. and truly I ſay,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45432:29"/> Such ſufferers doth the Father ſeek, that ſuffer in ſpirit and truth, whoſe ſpirits are ſavoury in their ſufferings. And when is that? when that your eye is more upon the publick good, then your own private loſs; more upon Gods deſigne, then your own detriment; more upon Gods diſhonour, then your own grievance, and your own preſſure.</p>
               <p>Sevently, if you would ſo order and manage all your ſufferings, as that they may turn to a good account, then let your eye be upon that, and obſerve what that is that you have moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, and that your heart is moſt upon in this world; and give that up to God the firſt thing you do: for truly nothing is done till that be done. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>God tempted Abraham.</hi> Divines obſerve, that <hi>Abraham</hi> met with ten tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prations; but it's never ſaid before, that God tempted him, till he ſpake to him to offer up his ſon <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Why there was his heart, and his love, and his delight. And where doth a mans tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion grow, but where his <hi>Iſaac</hi> is? he ſhall be ſure to be tried there. Here was <hi>Abrahams</hi> heart, here lay his temptation. And ſo, it may be, my heart is upon my houſe, or upon my land, or upon my trade; and I cannot part with this: I can part with any thing elſe, but when it comes to this, I am ready to ſay, The good Lord pardon me in this. Many ſay, I will not adventure to ſuffer any further for the Name of Chriſt, then I can ſecure my trade, or my land, or relations: but when it comes to this, I cannot part with theſe; I muſt have my trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here's a <hi>but</hi> comes in. <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> they parted with a great deal, but it came to little, becauſe they had a reſerve. And ſo if we have our reſerves with the Lord,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45432:30"/> our ſufferings will come to little. So that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that you give that up firſt to God that your hearts are moſt upon: for nothing is done in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering till that be done.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, if you would ſo order and manage your ſufferings, as they may turn to a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, then let the load, and let the weight and the burden of all your ſufferings be drawn upon the wheels of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love:</hi> thoſe two wheels of <hi>faith</hi> towards God, and <hi>love</hi> towards man. Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>By faith Moſes choſe rather to ſuffer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions with the people of God.</hi> How ſo? why <hi>by faith he ſaw him that is inviſible;</hi> and ſo trampled upon viſible things. And <hi>by faith he had an eye to the recompence of reward;</hi> and ſo overlooked theſe things. And <hi>by faith he ſaw greater wealth in the reproach of Christ, then in all the treaſures of Egypt.</hi> And ſo the three children, they ſuffered by faith, and it turned to a good account.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>love,</hi> you know what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If I give my body to be burnt, and want love, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> So then, as ever you deſire your ſufferings may turn to a good account, let your faith towards God, and your love towards man be exerciſed. And let theſe be the two great wheels that all your ſufferings ſhal be drawn upon.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, if you would order your ſufferings ſo as they may turn to a good account, then labour to be ſerviceable <hi>in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> your ſufferings. If ever God call you to a priſon, labour to be as ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> your ſuffering, as ever you can. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was in priſon; what came on't? was there any converted? No. Why ſo? <hi>Peter ſlept.</hi> I but <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> they ſang in the ſtocks, and they preach in the priſon, and there's the <hi>Jaylor</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45432:30"/> They were ſerviceable <hi>in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> their ſufferings, and it turned to a good account. And therefore if you would deſire that your ſufferings may turn to a good account, labour to be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>in</hi> &amp; <hi>by</hi> your ſufferings as God calls you into.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, when you have done all, and ſuffered all, then ſay, and think in truth, that you are unprofitable ſervants; and let your eye be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſufferings of Chriſt: offer your own ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings upon the ſufferings of Chriſt, in reference to your acceptance. For though you may <hi>have an eye to the recompence of reward,</hi> to <hi>encourage</hi> you to ſuffer; yet you are wholly to look to the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt in reference to your acceptance. And therefore when you have done all, think and ſay, you are unprofitable. <hi>Two men went up to pray, and the one he was a Phariſee, and the other a Publican.</hi> The Phariſee he comes and praiſes God he was not as the Publican: <hi>I thank God I am not as this Publican. I fast, and pray, and I am not as this Publican.</hi> Well, there comes the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, and he ſmites himſelf upon the breſt, and ſays, I am a poor ſinner: Oh! <hi>the Lord be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto me a poor ſinner.</hi> So ſay I, Two men go up to ſuffer, and there's one ſtands and vaunts, and ſaith, I thank the Lord I am not ſo coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and daſtardly as theſe poor-ſpirited men that dare do nothing; my fleſh ſhall fry in the fire. But the other ſtands at a diſtance, and ſaith, Oh, I am a poor creature, I am afraid to ſuffer, and I am afraid I ſhall betray the Cauſe of Chriſt. Now I tell you, this poor trembling ſoul that is laſt, ſhall be firſt, and <hi>he goes away rather juſtified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eleventhly, and laſtly, if you would ſo order and manage your ſufferings; as they may turn to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45432:31"/> a good account, praiſe God over your ſuffering, and pray to God under your ſuffering. I put theſe two together, <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>pray.</hi> This is a certain thing; thoſe ſufferings ſhall turn to a good account, that Chriſt bleſſes. How ſhall I know whether Chriſt will bleſs my ſufferings? Why if I can bleſs God over my ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And every one that hath forſaken houſes, or brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my Name ſake, ſhall receive an hundred-fold, and ſhall inherit everlasting life.</p>

               <p>IN this Scripture we have our Saviours anſwer unto <hi>Peters</hi> queſtion propounded at ver. 27. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) we have forſaken all, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thee: what ſhall we have therefore?</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour anſwers in the following verſes; and his anſwer is partly Comfortable, and partly Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal. The Cautional part I have ſpoken to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45432:32"/> ſome of you, from verſ. 30. <hi>But many that are firſt ſhall be last, and the last ſhall be firſt.</hi> The Comfortable part I ſpake unto the laſt Lords day in another Meeting. And being now deſired to ſpeak the ſame things unto you, conſidering that they are of preſent and univerſal concernment, I ſhall do it as briefly and plainly as I can.</p>
               <p>The Comfortable part of Chriſts anſwer you have in v. 28, 29. wherein our Saviour Chriſt doth ſhew what great reward thoſe ſhall have that do ſuffer, or leave any worldly intereſt for him, and for his Name-ſake. Which reward doth either relate unto the <hi>Apostles,</hi> or unto <hi>others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It relateth unto the Apoſtles, in verſ. 28. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that ye which have followed me in the regeneration,</hi> that is, in the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. Preaching of the Goſpel is a regenerating work. The preaching of the <hi>Law</hi> is <hi>convincing</hi> work; the preaching of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is <hi>regenerating</hi> work. <hi>Ye which have followed me in the regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in the great work of preaching the Goſpel; <hi>when the Son of man ſhall ſit in the throne of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ye alſo ſhall ſit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael.</hi> That's their reward, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and proper unto them.</p>
               <p>The reward which is more large, extending unto all, v. 29. And <hi>every one:</hi> not <hi>one of you</hi> ſhall be rewarded that are mine Apoſtles; but <hi>EVERY ONE that hath forſaken houſes, or brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or land, for my Name-ſake, ſhall receive an hundred-fold, and ſhall inherit everlasting life.</hi> From whence then I took up this Obſervation; and you may obſerve from the whole thus much:</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:45432:32"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>That whoſoever ſhall leave any worldly interest for Christ, and for his Name ſake, ſhall be ſure to be well rewarded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſhall be well rewarded: for he ſhall have <hi>an hundred-fold in this life, and everlasting life in the world to come.</hi> And he ſhall be <hi>ſure</hi> to be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded; for he hath put a <hi>verily</hi> upon it: <hi>Verily I ſay unto you,</hi> and <hi>every one that hath forſaken hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> &amp;c. So then, the Doctrine is clear, <hi>That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall leave or forſake any worldly interest for Christ, and for his Name-ſake, ſhall be ſure to be well rewarded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the clearing of this, firſt, we muſt enquire what it is to leave any worldly intereſt for Chriſt, and for his Name-ſake.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what the reward is that ſuch ſhall have that do ſo, and wherein it conſiſts. And</p>
               <p>Thirdly, what aſſurance we may have of ſuch a reward.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all, if you do enquire what it is to leave any thing for Chriſt, forſake any worldly intereſt for Chriſt:</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that a man may leave and forſake a worldly intereſt for Chriſt two ways:</p>
               <p>Either by his own will, or the wills of others.</p>
               <p>We do leave and forſake a worldly intereſt by our own wills, when we do voluntarily and freely deprive our ſelves of our commodity or ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for Chriſt; as the Apoſtles left their ſhips and nets to follow Chriſt.</p>
               <p>We (ſecondly) do leave or forſake a worldly intereſt by the wills of others, when through their oppreſſion or perſecution, we are deprived of our own commodity and ſatisfaction for Chriſt; and that is called ſuffering.</p>

               <p> Our Saviour Chriſt here, hath reſpect to both: and in both theſe reſpects it's true, <hi>That whoſoever doth leave any worldly interest for Christ, and his Name-ſake, ſhall be ſure to be well rewarded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then ſtill to clear it:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is it to leave any worldly intereſt for the <hi>Name</hi> of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Name</hi> of Chriſt is that whereby Chriſt is made known unto us; as the <hi>name</hi> of a man, is that whereby a man is made known unto us. A man is made known unto us by his name; ſo Chriſt is made known unto us by his Name. That whereby Chriſt is made known unto us, that's his Name.</p>
               <p>Now Chriſt is made known unto us by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and by the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>By his Spirit he is made known unto us: for as God the Father is made known unto us by Chriſt his Son: ſo Chriſt is made known unto us by the Spirit: <hi>He ſhall take of mine, and ſhew it unto you,</hi> ſuch Chriſt. And upon this account therefore, when a man doth ſuffer any thing for the Spirit, or for any working of the Holy-ghoſt upon his heart or ſoul, then he is ſaid to ſuffer for the <hi>Name</hi> of Chriſt. And upon this ſcore it was that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was accounted a Martyr of Chriſt, and enroll'd among the Martyrs of Chriſt: <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, if you look into the ſtory, did not ſuffer for any Goſpel-truth: <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt ſuffered for this, that he reprehended <hi>Herods</hi> adulterous courſes: true; but the Spirit of Chriſt put him upon it; and therefore being ſtirred up thereunto by the Spirit of Chriſt, he is ſaid to ſuffer upon the account of Chriſt. So that, I ſay, the Spirit of Chriſt is that whereby Chriſt is made known unto
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45432:34"/> us; and when a man doth therefore ſuffer for any work of the Spirit of Chriſt, then he is ſaid to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, Chriſt alſo is made known unto us by the Goſpel, as by an outward means. The Goſpel is the <hi>Name</hi> of Chriſt, whereby Chriſt is made known unto us. Every truth, is not a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-truth: 'tis poſſible that a man may ſuffer for a truth, and yet not ſuffer for a Goſpel-truth. But look when a man doth ſuffer for a truth, which is properly the truth of the Goſpel, then he is ſaid indeed to ſuffer for the <hi>Name</hi> of Chriſt, whereby Chriſt is made known. Would you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know when a man may be ſaid to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt? Take all together, thus: When a man doth ſuffer for that whereby Chriſt is made known unto us, then he ſuffers for the Name of Chriſt. Chriſt is made known unto us by the Spirit; he is made known unto us by the Goſpel. Look therefore when a man doth ſuffer for the work of the Spirit, which is properly the work of the Spirit; or ſuffer for the Truth, which is properly the Truth of the Goſpel: then plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is ſaid to ſuffer for the <hi>Name</hi> of Chriſt: and whoſoever doth ſo, ſhall be well rewarded. And that's the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. And then ſecondly, What is this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that thoſe ſhall have, that do leave any worldly intereſt for Chriſt, or for the Name of Chriſt; and wherein doth that conſiſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The reward is <hi>great;</hi> and it will appear to be very great, if you look into and conſider this text and Scripture well. For this reward, it doth relate unto the <hi>Apostles,</hi> or it relates unto <hi>us;</hi> to all others that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o leave any wordly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt upon the account of Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:45432:35"/>
               <p> Now as for the Apoſtles, their reward is here ſet down, <hi>That they ſhall ſit with Christ on his throne.</hi> When Chriſt ſits on his throne, <hi>the Apostles ſhall ſit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> For the clearing of this, onely theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What it is for the Apoſtles to <hi>ſit on twelve thrones with Chriſt, judging the twelve tribes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And 2. Whether are there any <hi>degrees of glory,</hi> ſeeing that the Apoſtles here ſeem to have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of glory given them above other men.</p>
               <p>And as for the firſt, briefly thus.</p>
               <p>When Chriſt ſhall ſit upon the throne, they are ſaid to ſit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes; to note their communion and fellowſhip with Chriſt in his Judicial kingdom.</p>
               <p>But whereas <hi>the Saints ſhall judge the world;</hi> 'tis true, the Saints ſhall judge the world, and ſhall have communion and fellowſhip with Chriſt in that great work of judging the world. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles they ſhall ſit as aſſeſſors on that day: at the great Aſſizes, the Apoſtles ſhall ſit on the bench as aſſeſſors, or as Juſtices of the Peace, by the Judge; and ſo ſhall have communion with him. 'Tis true, that all the Saints ſhall judge the world by their lives, and by their converſations: but the twelve Apoſtles ſhall judge the world by their Doctrine: not onely by conſenting to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, as all the Saints ſhall do; but in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16. 'tis ſaid, <hi>In the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to my Goſpel.</hi> So that this is all that is here meant, That in the grand and great Aſſize, that kingdom and glory of Chriſt, the twelve Apoſtles they ſhall have a ſpecial fellowſhip and communion with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:45432:35"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But then, are there any degrees of glory? for it would ſeem here, that the Apoſtles have ſome degree of glory above other men. Are there any degrees of glory?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes ſurely, there are degrees of glory. For <hi>as one ſtar differeth from another ſtar in glory, ſo ſhall the reſurrection be,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>But though there be degrees of glory, all that glory that the Saints ſhall have in heaven, ſhall be of one piece; for there's no envie there. <hi>Envie!</hi> there is none in heaven. And whence comes Envie? We may ſee that among our children, or among men. If you have four or five cchildren, and make them cloaths, if they be cloaths made all of a piece, they do not envie though ones cloaths be bigger then anothers. But if they be not made all of a piece, or my Brothers cloaths are better then mine, or my Siſters cloaths are better then mine; but when they are all of a piece, they do not envie. So if you invite twenty men to dinner, and they all eat of the ſame diſh, there's no envie: but if you have a meaner diſh for thoſe that ſit at the lower end of the Table, ſay they, Indeed we ſat at ſuch a Table but we had a meaner diſh: and ſo they envie. But if one man eat more then another, yet if they eat of the ſame diſh, there is no envie. Now in heaven there is no Envie: for though there be degrees of glory, yet it ſhall be all of a piece, and all of a diſh. But now though this glory in heaven ſhall be all of a piece, and though there be degrees of glory in heaven, yet I don't think this Scripture to be underſtood of the degrees of glory in heaven; for there's no judging of the twelve tribes in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: <hi>Christ ſhall then</hi> at laſt <hi>give up his kingdom unto the Father.</hi> This is ſpoken therefore of a glorious Judgement on this ſide heaven; and it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45432:36"/> is here promiſed unto the Apoſtles above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as a reward ſutable to them: for they were twelve, preached to the twelve tribes; ſome received the Goſpel, ſome did not: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here is a reward propounded ſutable unto them. But thus much for the reward that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Apoſtles, (by the way).</p>
               <p>But then it will be ſaid, What is the reward that doth concern all thoſe that leave any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſt for Chriſt, or ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Why that doth either relate unto this life, or unto the life that is to come.</p>
               <p>It relates unto this life; and then ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>There is an hundred-fold.</hi> Look whatſoever that is that you do lay out for Chriſt here in this life, you ſhall receive an hundred-fold for it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this life.

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> matter to have the favour of God the Father, the heart of God
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45432:37"/> drawn out unto us, to be amiable and beautiful in the eyes of God the Father? Now look when a man doth forſake any worldly intereſt for God, then he is beautiful in the eyes of God; never ſo amiable or beautiful in the eyes of God, as then. Take it thus:</p>
               <p>Beauty raiſes Perſecution, and Perſecution raiſes Beauty: they are matual cauſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, Beauty raiſes Perſecution. Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you ſhall find doth always fall upon the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful piece of Religion, upon thoſe that are the moſt beautiful pieces of Religion. So long as Chriſt our Saviour liv'd, perſecution lay upon him, and not upon the Apoſtles: when Chriſt was dead, then the Apoſtles were the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful piece, and then the perſecution lay upon them eſpecially. When the Apoſtles were gone off the ſtage, in the Primitive times, the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution always fell upon the moſt eminent Saints. Perſecution always falls upon the beauty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 13 we finde that perſecution is compared to the ſcorching of the Sun: <hi>And when the ſun was up, they were ſcorched;</hi> ſpeaking of the ſtony ground: which is expounded in verſ. 21. by perſecution: <hi>For when tribulation or perſecution ariſes becauſe of the word.</hi> The <hi>ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſun</hi> here, is interpreted to be <hi>perſecution.</hi> And you ſhall finde that the ſcorching Sun falls with moſt prejudice upon the greateſt beauty: the greateſt beauty ſuffers moſt by the ſcorching ſun. Truly ſo perſecution falls upon the beauty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: you may ſee it in <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. there the Spouſe is deſcribed in her beauty: <hi>If thou know not, O thou fairest among women,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horſes in Pharaohs</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:45432:37"/> 
                  <hi>chariots. Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold.</hi> But ſaith ſhe, at verſ. 5. <hi>I am black but comely, O ye daughters of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> Here's her beauty: what then? <hi>Look not upon me becauſe I am black, becauſe the ſun hath look'd upon me. The ſun hath look'd upon me:</hi> what's that? Perſecution: <hi>My mothers children were angry with me.</hi> The ſcorching ſun of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution hath fallen upon my beauty. That's the thing I ſpeak of, namely, that Perſecution always falls upon the beautiful piece of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>And ſo on the other ſide, as Beauty raiſes Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, ſo Perſecution raiſes Beauty. A man's never more beautiful in the eyes of God, then when he is perſecuted for the Name of Chriſt, and when he doth leave and forſake a worldly intereſt upon the account of Chriſt. You may ſee it in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. verſ. 10. <hi>Hearken O daughter, conſider, and incline thine ear; forget alſo thine own people, and thy fathers houſe: ſo ſhall the King great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire thy beauty.</hi> See where the <hi>beauty</hi> lies, in <hi>forgetting of the fathers houſe:</hi> in leaving and forſaking a worldly intereſt upon the account of Chriſt, here's beauty. Now is it not an hundred times better to be beautiful in the eyes of God the Father, and of Chriſt, then to have a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſt? Certainly it is.</p>
               <p>But then thirdly, Is it not a great matter for a man to have communion and fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt in his ſufferings? <hi>If ye ſuffer with him, ye ſhall reign with him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Now we have communion and fellowſhip with Chriſt in his ſufferings, either at the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45432:38"/> or in our ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that here's a ſpecialty of communion with Chriſt, by ſuffering for the Lord Jeſus. Now is it not an hundred times better to have communion and fellowſhip with Chriſt in his ſufferings, then to have a worldly intereſt?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, is it not a great mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Why if you look into <hi>Mark</hi> 10. you ſhall finde that <hi>Mark</hi> doth not ſay in ſo many words, that we ſhall have an hundred-fold in this life, in the ſame kinde; but ſaith thus: <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, that there is no man that hath left houſe, or brethren, or ſiſter, or father, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or wife, or children, or lands, for my ſake and the Goſpels, but he ſhall receive an hundred-fold now in this time, houſes, and brethren, and ſiſters, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and children, and lands, with PERSEC<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS.</hi> But he do'nt ſay he ſhall have it in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e ſame kinde, An hundred-fold in this life, and an hundred-fold in the ſame kinde. When <hi>Peter</hi> left his nets and his fiſhing for Chriſt, Chriſt made him a fiſher of men: now that was an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Firſt, conſider this: whatſoever God doth for us immediately, that is an hundred times better, then what he doth for us by means. Now look when a man doth forſake a worldly intereſt for Chriſt, and puts himſelf upon Chriſt, Chriſt will provide immediately for him. You may ſee it in <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. there were a company that had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Chriſt, and had followed him ſo long, that they were faint: Chriſt would not ſend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way fainting, verſ. 32. <hi>Jeſus called his diſciples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and ſaid, I have compaſſion on the multitude, becauſe they have continued with me now three days, and have nothing to eat. They have nothing to eat:</hi> they had left their houſes, they had left their own victuals, and their own proviſions, and they had nothing to eat; and (ſaith he) <hi>I will not ſend them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</hi> Well, what ſhall be done? here Chriſt works a miracle; <hi>And they took up of the broken meat that was left ſeven bask<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The reaſon is this, becauſe in the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment all inſtitutions are commanded; all the inventions of men are forbidden. All the inſtitutions of Chriſt come within the ſecond Commandment; and therefore, ſaith he, <hi>I will ſhew mercy to a thouſand generations of thoſe that l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wn to a thouſand generations. Well, what God gives to our children, and to our poſterity, that he gives unto us.</p>
               <p>A third conſideration is this. Look what that is which we have in eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct, that we have in truth, though we have it not in the formality. Now look whatſoever you do lay out for Chriſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever worldly intereſt you do part withal, and forſake for Chriſt, that you ſhall have in effect. Why? becauſe the ſame affection doth ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. I will expreſs it thus: Suppoſe you have a Crab-ſtock, and there you plant a Harvie, or a Pearmain, or a Pippin; why the Pippin is an hundred times better then the Crab would have been. Why 'tis the ſame ſtock ſtill, under the Harvie, or Pippin, or Pearmain; onely there's an Apple planted that's an hundred times bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Crab was. So now, you have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the things of the world: well, you leave this delight for Chriſt; you leave not the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but there's a better object planted upon the affection; and there being a better object planted upon the ſame delight, thus you have
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45432:41"/> the ſame thing you part withal for the Name of Chriſt in an hundred-fold.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, look what that is that we have in a way of ſubſtitution, that we have in truth, and in effect, though we have it not in formality. Now look what that is that you do leave for the Name of Chriſt, that you ſhall have an hundred-fold in a way of ſubſtitution. The Apoſtles they left their houſes; <hi>Peter</hi> left a houſe, it may be, or a fiſher-boat, for Chriſt: why he had an hundred houſes in a way of ſubſtitution, he had an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred mens houſes open to receive him; and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie was that <hi>Lydia</hi> that could receive the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. And this is that which you have <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. verſ. 10. <hi>Hearken, O daughter, and conſider; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline thine ear: forget alſo thine own people, and thy fathers houſe.</hi> What then? Why then at verſ. 16. <hi>In ſtead of thy fathers ſhall be thy children, whom thou mayſt make Princes in all the earth.</hi> Here now is the ſame, in a way of ſubſtitution. 'Tis true, 'tis not the ſame in formality, but in a way of ſubſtitution; here's that which is an hundred-fold.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, look what that is which we have in a way of ſatisfaction, that we have in truth and in effect, though not in formality. Look what that is that you do leave or forſake for Chriſt, that you ſhall have in ſatisfaction an hundred-fold more then you had before. If you leave any thing for Chriſt, you ſhall have an hundred-fold more ſatisfaction in what you have given for Chriſt, then what you keep for your ſelves. So that an hundred-fold in a way of ſubſtitution, and an hundred-fold in a way of ſatisfaction. And thus you ſee how we receive an hundred-fold
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45432:41"/> in this life: That whatſoever you do lay out for Chriſt here, you ſhall be paid an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred-fold; and how, and in what manner.</p>
               <p>But then ſecondly, what is that reward that we ſhall have in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he life to come? Suppoſe a man do leave a worldly intereſt for the Name of Chriſt, or that he do ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt; what is that reward that he ſhall have in the world to come?</p>
               <p>Truly that reward is great, and I am not able to ſpeak it; it requires the unwearied hand and arm of Eternity, to tell over all the wealth of glory that the ſuffering people of God ſhall have in the world to come. Onely thus much I'll ſay, and briefly.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, That reward that you that are ſuffering Saints ſhall have in the world to come, it ſhall be an <hi>open</hi> reward: for, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>he that confeſſeth me before men, him will I confeſs alſo before my Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſhall be a <hi>comfortable</hi> reward: for, ſaith the book of the <hi>Revelations, Then all tears ſhall be wiped out of your eyes.</hi> He doth not ſay, <hi>From</hi> your eyes, or <hi>from</hi> your cheeks; no, but they ſhall be wiped <hi>out of</hi> your eyes. So that the eyes ſhall be then ſuch a womb as ſhall never breed a tear again. All tears ſhall be wiped not <hi>from</hi> your eyes, but <hi>out of</hi> your eyes. So in <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as it ſhall be a comfortable reward, ſo an <hi>honourable</hi> reward: for, ſaith our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Be faithful unto the death, and I will give thee the crown of life.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as it ſhall be an honourable reward, ſo a <hi>proportionable</hi> reward, a reward proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all your ſufferings. You know what the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45432:42"/> Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Theſe light affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ctions which are but for a moment, work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Will you ſay, I but our afflictions are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding heavie. Nay, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>they are light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But grant they be; to balance the account, you ſhall have <hi>a weight of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Will you ſay, They are <hi>long</hi> and tedious.</p>
               <p>Nay, ſaith the Apoſtle, they are but <hi>light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But grant they be long and tedious.</p>
               <p>To balance the account, you ſhall have <hi>an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and an eternal weight of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then fifthly, as it ſhall be a reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable, ſo it ſhall be a reward <hi>tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> over and beyond proportion, over and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all expreſſion, beyond all our apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or thoughts. Who is able to think or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what <hi>the inheritance of the Saints in light</hi> is; that inheritance that is incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away? Look into <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>If ye be children, then are ye heirs, heirs of God, and joynt-heirs with Christ; if ſo be that we ſuffer with him.</hi> See, it hangs upon ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together.</hi> Now, <hi>if children, then heirs.</hi> All our children are not heirs: well, but all the children of God ſhall be heirs, <hi>heirs of God.</hi> What's that? Some think that's to be underſtood objectively, that they ſhall inherit God: and indeed, they have all things, that have him that hath all things. <hi>Heirs of God.</hi> But take it efficiently, ſhall be Gods heirs, and <hi>joynt-heirs with Chriſt.</hi> He doth not ſay, Joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purchaſers with Chriſt, but joynt-heirs, <hi>joynt-heirs</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:45432:42"/> 
                  <hi>with Chriſt.</hi> What ſhall Chriſt inherit? Why Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iſt is God the Fathers heir; and <hi>he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſpleaſed his Fath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r;</hi> he will not diſinherit him therefore. Look what God the Father is worth, that Chriſt ſhall be worth: and look what Chriſt is worth, that the ſuffering Saints ſhall be worth: for they be <hi>joynt-heirs with Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lo here, here's an inheritance now, and here's the reward that the ſuffering Saints ſhall have. What a large inheritance is here! This is that they ſhall have in the life to come. And ſo you ſee what their reward is that loſe or forſake any thing upon the account of Chriſt, or ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r for the Name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But then thirdly, what aſſurance is there of this reward?</p>
               <p>I'll go no further then the text: our Saviour Chriſt here puts a <hi>Verily</hi> upon it: <hi>Verily:</hi> you have the word of Chriſt for this reward. If an honeſt man make you a promiſe, you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, eſpecially if he ſaith, I proteſt unto you. Why Jeſus Chriſt hath proteſted this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: <hi>Verily,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>you ſhall have an hundred-fold in this life, and in the world to come, life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well then, the queſtion is, Why ſhould thoſe that ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt have ſuch a great reward as this? Why ſhould thoſe that leave or forſake any worldly intereſt upon the account of Chriſt, why ſhould thoſe above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people be ſo well rewarded?</p>
               <p>I anſwer: Theſe above all other people, that ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt, theſe are thoſe that do honour Jeſus Chriſt. What is honour?
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45432:43"/> Honour, it is the teſtimony of anothers excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie. When I teſtifie of another mans excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, then I honour him. Now look when a man doth forſake a worldly intereſt for the truth of Chriſt, then he teſtifie there's an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie in Chriſt: and the greater the worldly intereſt is I do forſake, and the leſs the truth is I forſake it for; the more do I teſtifie an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie in Chriſt: Chriſt therefore will be ſure to honour them, they ſhall be well rewarded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, theſe people of all other people, are the people that do truſt in the Lord before the ſons of men: <hi>O how great is thy loving kindneſs, which thou haſt laid up for them that fear thee; which thou haſt wrought for them that truſt in thee, before the ſons of men!</hi> Some truſt in God, and believe in the heart (as they ſay): But they do not truſt in God before the Sons of men. But now, when a man forſakes a worldly intereſt, and doth ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt, then he truſts in the Lord before the ſons of men: And therefore, O how great is the loving kindneſs of God that is laid up for them!</p>
               <p>But then thirdly, theſe above all other people that ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt: theſe are thoſe people that are firm and faſt unto God. God loves a fixed Spirit. God doth not love to ſee a man unſetled in points of Religion. Now when a man will leave a worldly intereſt for the Cauſe of Chriſt, and the Name of Chriſt, there's a fixation in ſuch a man. And therefore he of all other people ſhall be well rewarded.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, theſe people of all other people, are the moſt oppoſed by the Grand Enemy of Chriſt: Well, who is the Grand Enemy of Chriſt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45432:43"/> in theſe days? Antichriſt: Antichriſt is the Grand Enemy of Jeſus Chriſt. Now theſe that ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt, are moſt oppoſed by the Grand Enemy of Chriſt: And Chriſt will be ſure to love them that are moſt oppoſed by his Grand Enemy.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and laſtly, theſe of all other people, they are the people that are <hi>overcomers:</hi> How many promiſes are made to thoſe that overcome, in the ſecond and third of the <hi>Revelations? To him that overcometh, to him that overcometh,</hi> a promiſe ſtill is made to him that overccometh.</p>
               <p>But how do we overcome?</p>
               <p>In the 12 of the <hi>Revelat. v.</hi> 11. <hi>And they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him,</hi> that is, the Devil, <hi>By the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their teſtimony, and they loved not their lives unto the death.</hi> Theſe of all other people, are the overcoming people. As Chriſt overcame the Devil, by being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; ſo men overcome, by being overcome. Thoſe that ſuffer upon the account of Jeſus Chriſt, when they are overcome by the world in the view of the world, then they overcome. Now Chriſt will be ſure to reward them well that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome. And thus you ſee why theſe of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people ſhall be ſo well rewarded. And thus you have the Doctrine cleered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Applicat.</hi> Now then by way of Application.</p>
               <p>If this be true, that whoſoever doth leave or forſake any worldly intereſt for Chriſt, and the Name of Chriſt, ſhall be ſure to be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded: why ſhould not we be willing to looſe and to be loſt for Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Good Friends, the time's a coming when you may be called to leave your Trades, to leave your Shops, to leave any worldly intereſt you have for
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45432:44"/> the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. But is this true, that ſuch ſhall be well rewarded? Why ſhould we not be willing then to looſe and be loſt, to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt? Can you have a greater improvement of your Money? A man would think he improves his Money well that hath ten in the hundred, ſix in the hundred now: But here's an hundred for one; not ten in the hundred, but an hundred for one. If a Merchant ventures to Sea, if he could be ſure to gain twelve in the hundred, he would think he came to a good Market. <hi>Why behold here, here's an hundred fold in this life, and all this inſured by Christ; Verily, verily I ſay unto you.</hi> 'Tis inſured by the word of Jeſus Chriſt; not ten, but an hundred; not twelve in the hundred, but an hundred for one, even in this life. Who would not be willing to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt? 'Tis recorded of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> That when ſhe was in the Tower, ſhe lookt out of a Window, and ſaw a milk-maid go by ſinging; and ſeeing her, O, ſaid ſhe, that I were a Milk-maid, then I ſhould go ſinging! But when ſhe came to the Throne, ſhe reigned forty four years. Now had ſhe known that ſhe ſhould have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from her impriſonment, and brought to the Throne, and there have reigned forty four years; would ſhe have wiſht her ſelf a Milk-maid? Beloved, we are aſſured of a great reward in Heaven, an hundred fold in this life, and a great and glorious reward in the life to come; and therefore when we come to ſuffer, ſhall I peeviſhly ſay, Would I had been a Milk-maid? would I had been born in a mean condition? O no! how willing ſhould we be to ſuffer for the Name of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:45432:44"/>
               <p> But ſome will ſay, I am not unwilling to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt, ſo it be for the Name of Chriſt, but there are many falſe gloſſes put upon our ſufferings.</p>
               <p>Saith the Adverſary, Man, friend, you don't ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt, and the truth of Chriſt; but for Sedition and Rebellion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you will not be obedient to Authority; and theſe and the like gloſſes are put upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. And how can I be willing to ſuffer now?</p>
               <p>No Indeed, if theſe things be true: for the Apoſtle ſaith, That <hi>we are not to ſuffer as evil doers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I pray tell me, When did any of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God ſuffer for the Cauſe of God; but there were ſuch gloſſes as theſe? ſaith <hi>Haman, Theſe are a rebellious people, and it is not for the Kings profit to ſuffer them.</hi> And ſo when Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuffered, He is not a friend to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but an enemy. Well, then came the Apoſtles, and when the Apoſtles came, what a guiſe was put upon their ſufferings? Theſe <hi>are ſeditious,</hi> and <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe that turn the world upſide-down are come hither.</hi> And do not you finde in Scripture and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that <hi>it is no new thing for men to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Religion upon the account of Religion?</hi> Saith Chriſt, <hi>For which of my good works go ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to kill me? No, no, thou art miſtaken, we go not about to kill thee for thy good works, but becauſe thou breakest the Sabbath,</hi> &amp;c. So that 'tis no new thing to perſecute Religion, even upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Religion.</p>
               <p>But then you will ſay, If it be ſo, how ſhall I be able to know that I do truely ſuffer for the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45432:45"/> Name of Chriſt? How ſhall I be able in the midſt of all theſe <hi>blinds</hi> and <hi>diſguiſes?</hi> How ſhall I ſee through them all, that I may be able to ſay, Nay, but in truth, I do ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Why, you have heard it in the general al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; onely a little more particularly to open it.</p>
               <p>If you do ſuffer for the Work of the Spirit of God upon your heart, the Work that the Holy Ghoſt hath wrought upon your heart: If you do ſuffer for the Truth, which is properly the Truth of the Goſpel; whatſoever diſguiſes men put upon your ſufferings, plainly you ſuffer for Name of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, if you ſuffer for the Cauſe of Chriſt, for the Ways of Chriſt, for the Ordinances of Chriſt, for the Children of Chriſt, for the Liberty which Chriſt hath purchaſed for you; then you do ſuffer for the Name of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, if you do ſuffer for the worſhip of Chriſt, as it is diſtinguiſht from <hi>Jewiſh</hi> worſhip, from <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> worſhip, from <hi>Worldly</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; then you ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt. for the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of Chriſt, is the <hi>Name</hi> of Chriſt: And all Nations go forth in the <hi>Name</hi> of their God. Now if you do ſuffer for the worſhip of Chriſt, as it is diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> worſhip, from <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> worſhip, from <hi>Worldly</hi> worſhip; then you do plainly ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The worſhip of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the way of the <hi>Jews</hi> was National; but the worſhip of Chriſt and the Goſpel is Congregational.</p>
               <p>The worſhip of Chriſt is diſtinguiſht from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45432:45"/> worſhip: For that's humane, and by humane inventions; but the worſhip of Jeſus Chriſt is Divine, and from Heaven.</p>
               <p>The worſhip of Chriſt is diſtinguiſht from the worſhip of the world, for that's Pompous, that's Ceremonious; a carnal worſhip like unto the world it ſelf; but the worſhip Jeſus Chriſt is plain and ſimple. Such worſhippers doth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeek, as worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth. Now if you do ſuffer for the worſhip of Chriſt, as it is diſtinguiſht from the worſhip of the Jews; Antichriſt, and of the World; then you do cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if you do ſuffer for the not-doing of that, which Jeſus Chriſt hath juſtified his own Diſciples for the not doing of, then do you ſuffer for the Goſpel, and ſo for the Name of Jeſus Chriſt. Now look into the 15 of <hi>Matth.</hi> and you ſhall ſee what Chriſt did juſtifie his Diſciples in. And the Scribes and the Phariſees came to Chriſt, and they ſay unto him, <hi>Why do thy Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples tranſgreſs the tradition of the Elders?</hi> What's that? <hi>for they waſh not their hands when they eat bread.</hi> VVhy that's an indifferent thing; ſurely the Diſciples would not ſtand off for an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing. Yes that they did, I and Chriſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified them in it.</p>
               <p>But this was hatcht with the tradition of the Elders of the Church, and ſurely they would not ſtand off now. Yes, that they did, and Chriſt juſtifies them in it, for Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Why do you alſo tranſgreſs the commandments of God by your tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi> So that if you do ſuffer for not doing that, which Jeſus Chriſt hath juſtified his Diſciples for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45432:46"/> the not doing of; then you ſuffer for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and for the Name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If two things be laid before you, and there is ſin on the one hand, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand there is ſuffering for Chriſt: Sin on the one hand, and ſuffering on the other: If now you chuſe rather to take up the ſuffering, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to commit the ſin; you do plainly ſuffer for the Name of Jeſus Chriſt. And therefore look whatſoever the reward is, that great reward is which they ſhall have that ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt; all that reward is yours. Be of good comfort, all that reward is yours: O, and if ever you be call'd to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt, go away rejoycing that you are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy to ſuffer ſhame, or any thing for the Name of Jeſus Chriſt. O what great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is here from this great Rewarder! Who would not be willing now to ſuffer for the Name of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>But you will ſay to me, What ſhall we do that we may be willing to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt? for I confeſs I am very backward and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Do you ſay ſo?</p>
               <p>But it may be you are not convinced that it is for the Name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But are you ſenſible of your unwillingneſs? Why, I uſe to ſay this, He is not far from a grace that is ſenſible of a contrary evil: And 'tis a true ſpeech, He is not far from humility that is ſenſible of pride; he is not far from faith, that is ſenſible of unbelief. So he is not far from being willing to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt that is ſenſible of his own unwillingneſs.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:45432:46"/>
               <p> But now ſuppoſe that for the preſent you be very unwilling to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>You may know this, That willingneſs to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the Name of Chriſt, is part of our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace; and ſuffering Grace is given upon ſuffering ground: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you it is given not only to believe, but to ſuffer.</hi> The opportunity to ſuffer is the gift of God. The will and heart to ſuffer is the gift of God. And the ſtrength to ſuffer is the gift of God. Theſe are three gifts in one gift.</p>
               <p>But when is this ſuffering grace given?</p>
               <p>It's given upon ſuffering ground: In <hi>that hour</hi> there ſhall be wiſdom given you: well, to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt, is part of our ſuffering grace; and therefore when you come upon the ſuffering ground, then you ſhall have the ſuffering grace.</p>
               <p>I but you will ſay, Indeed I find my heart ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly backward to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt. What ſhall I do, that I may be willing now for the preſent to ſuffer for the Cauſe or the Name of Chriſt? Here are divers Directions.</p>
               <floatingText xml:lang="eng" type="directions">
                  <body>
                     <head>Directions to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt.</head>
                     <p>Firſt, Whenſoever you do receive any thing from God, when you do receive it, then ingage your hearts to offer it up unto God, when God calls for it again, to lay it out for God. And if at any time you find your hearts willing, then pray to God, and ſay, The Lord continue this in the thoughts of my poor heart for ever: when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you receive, then ingage, and keep this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement freſh upon your hearts.</p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:45432:47"/>
                     <p> Secondly, Train up your ſelves in leaving and forſaking a worldly intereſt for the Name of Chriſt; the Goſpel calls for this work daily: for you know the Parable: <hi>A certain man made a great feast, and invited many; and ſent his ſervant at Supper-time to ſay to them that were bidden, Come, for all things are now ready. And they all with one conſent began to make excuſe. One ſaid, I have bought a piece of ground, and I muſt go ſee it: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid, I have bought five yoke of Oxen, and I muſt go prove them: Another ſaid, I have married a wife, and therefore cannot come.</hi> All theſe were excuſes. But we ſhould daily be parting with a worldly intereſt for the Goſpel and Name of God. It was a true ſpeech of Mr. <hi>Greenham,</hi> He will never be able to ſuffer by a Papiſt, that cannot ſuffer from a Proteſtant. Train up your ſelves every day; daily you muſt meet with one Temptation or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, therefore be daily training your ſelves up in this work of leaving and forſaking your world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſt for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Uſe the World as if you us'd it not, for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away. He that is glewed to the world, will never leave and forſake much of the worldly intereſt for the name of Jeſus Chriſt: the more a mans heart is glew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the world and the things thereof, the more unwilling he will be to part with a worldly intereſt for Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore let him that uſes the world, be as if he uſed it not; he that marries, as if he married not; and they that weep, as if they wept not; and they that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not; and they that buy, as though they poſſeſſed not; and they that uſe this world, as not abuſing it; for the faſhion of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45432:47"/> this world paſſeth away. Witneſs the Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theſe latter times.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Study Chriſt crucified much: Let me ſay this to you, and to my ſelf (and I pray conſider of it) the more frequently and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we do think on Chriſt crucified, and what Chriſt did leave and forſake for us, the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſhall we be to leave and forſake any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſt for Jeſus Chriſt. I ſhould think thus: What, ſhall Chriſt leave his <hi>Heaven</hi> for me, and ſhall not I leave my <hi>Earth</hi> for him? What, ſhall Jeſus Chriſt leave the boſome of his Father, and that ſweet Relation for me, and ſhall not I leave the boſome of my Relation for him! What, ſhall Jeſus Chriſt ſuffer for me <hi>a curſed death,</hi> and ſhall not I be willing to ſuffer a <hi>bleſſed death</hi> for him? The Death of Chriſt hath bleſſed our death: Chriſt hath ſuffered a curſed death for us, and our death is made bleſſed by the death of Chriſt. And ſhall Chriſt ſuffer a curſed death for me, and ſhall not I be willing to ſuffer a bleſſed death for him? Think much of what Chriſt left for you, and then you will be willing to forſake any worldly intereſt for him.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Get your hearts filled with the divine ſweetneſſes of the Ordinances. O Lord, ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> when once thy ſweetneſs came into my Soul, how ſweet was it to me to want my own ſweetneſſes! Oh! when the ſweetneſſes of God ſhall come into our Souls, this begets Love; and much water cannot quench Love. Go there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and labour to get your hearts filled with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſweetneſſes.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Whatſoever you do now in a way of ſervice, do it becauſe your Father wills it. If you
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45432:48"/> do therefore ſerve God now becauſe your Father wills it; then when you come to ſuffer, you will willingly ſuffer, becauſe your Father wills it. So that now, uſe your ſelves to this, to ſerve all your ſervice upon this ſcore, becauſe my Father wills it.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Take heed that you do not ſtand leſsning of a ſin, or of an error, and greatning of a ſuffering. What's the reaſon that many are ſo unwilling to ſuffer? The reaſon on't is this: they leſſen the error and the ſin in the yeilding; and they aggravate and greaten the ſuffering. O ſaith one, Is this a great matter, to yeild in ſuch a thing as this! 'tis an indifferent thing; but if I don't yeild, I am undone for ever. But take heed of this, that you do not leſſen the ſin, and aggravate your ſuffering: for you will never be willing to ſuffer for the name of Chriſt, if this be your way.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, If you would be willing to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt, then go unto God in prayer, and pray unto God for boldneſs; and go to your friends, and beg of them to pray for you. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member when <hi>Latimer</hi> was to ſuffer, he call'd upon his friends, Pray friends, pray for me; for ſometimes, though I am as bold as a Lyon, yet at another time I am ſo afraid, as I could run into a Mouſe-hole. Therefore ſay, Come, O my friends, I have a cowardly heart of my own, and am unwilling to ſuffer for the Name of Jeſus Chriſt: O friends, pray for me, and go to God and pray for boldneſs: for you ſee how it was in the 4th of the <hi>Acts,</hi> they told their own Company what the Prieſts ſaid to them, <hi>And now, Lord,</hi> ſay they, <hi>Behold their threatnings:</hi> and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45432:48"/> what did they pray for? <hi>Grant that with all boldneſs we may ſpeak thy word:</hi> And what was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he iſſue? in the next verſe: <hi>The room was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and they were filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and they ſpake the word of God with boldneſs.</hi> God anſwered their prayer preſently. Therefore if the Enemies threaten, and you are afraid to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt, get together, and in the midſt of all your Petitions, put up this to the Throne of Grace, O Lord, give us boldneſs.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, If you would be willing to ſuffer for the name of Chriſt, O then read over the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of others, and how others have offered up their worldly intereſts to the name of Chriſt; and by reading their ſufferings, you will be made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſuffer as they were: <hi>Having ſuch a cloud of witneſſes,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; he ſpeaks of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-Saints.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, Improve all your afflictions to the mortification of your mind, and of your will: Take this for certain; truly, the more your own mind and will is alive, the more you will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt. Well, how ſhall I mortifie my own will? Afflictions will help you do it. Affliction! Whats affliction? Affliction is all that that is contrary to ones will; thereby God eats out the core of our wills. Whenſoever therefore you meet with any affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, pray over it, and beg that God would eat out the core of your wills thereby: and the more the core of your wills is eaten out, the more willing will you be to ſuffer for the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, And then to draw to a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that you may be willing to ſuffer for the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45432:49"/> Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, lay theſe things and this great reward wiſhly upon your hearts, and thereby you will be made more willing. You ſee how it is with a man that's going to Court, he rides through this plaſh, and the other plaſh; I am going to Court, and there I ſhall be made a man, if I get but thither. Why, truly we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Court of the King of Kings, and theſe ſufferings that we meet withal, are the plaſhes by the way. But Chriſtians, there's enough in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to pay for all. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, Let him be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that can be miſerable. So you that ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt, you cannot be miſerable, Chriſt hath pronounc'd you bleſſed, and you ſhall be bleſſed: and you ſee what a reward here is in the Text; <hi>An hundred fold in this life, and in the world to come life everlaſting.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p>I ſhall only ſay, this is the parting Speech: There is no loſs in looſing for Jeſus Chriſt; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you do looſe for Chriſt, you ſhall find it infinitely in Chriſt: Chriſt and a little, is a great deal. The only way to have a mercy, is to be content to go without it: And the only way to prevent a miſery, is to be willing to endure it. Now therefore, if you would prevent ſuffering, be willing to ſuffer for the Name of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee what the means are to be made willing. And ſo I have done with this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of Chriſt. In this part of the Anſwer you ſee how we may be made willing to ſuffer for Chriſt; and in the cautional part, ſome of you heard how we ſhould ſo order our ſufferings, as that they might turn to a good account.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</hi>

               <p>The riſing time, and reſtoring time, from the 11. verſe unto the 14. So that in this Scripture that I have now read, you have the ſtate of the Church Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying, or Witneſſing in the dayes of Anti-Chriſt, called Witneſſes: who are here deſcribed,</p>
               <p>Firſt by their number <hi>Two. I will give power unto my two Witneſſes.</hi>

               <p>Sixthly, By the great things that they ſhall do, in the latter end of their Propheſie, <hi>Theſe have power to ſhut Heaven, that it rain not in the dayes of their Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and have power over waters to turn them into Bloud, &amp;c.</hi> So that now from all this, I take up this one Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

               <p>Fifthly, What is their Defence and Guard where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are Guarded and Defended in the daies of their Propheſie.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, What are the great things that they ſhall do in the latter end of their Propheſie. (I ſhall run through theſe particulars as briefly as I may), And</p>
               <p>Firſt, If you ask why the Saints and people of God are here called Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Becauſe it is their work and buſineſs to bear Witneſs to the truths and wayes of Chriſt, in oppoſition to the wayes of Anti-Chriſt. If you look into this Book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> you will find they are ſo deſcribed, by bearing witneſs unto the waies and the truths of Chriſt, in oppoſition to the waies of Anti-Chriſt. For look but a little into this Book, and you ſhall find that there are two ſorts of people that are marked: The followers of the Beaſt are marked, and the followers of the Lamb are marked in their Foreheads.</p>
               <p>The followers of the Beaſt are marked, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 16. <hi>And he cauſeth all, both ſmall and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a Mark in their right hand, or in their Foreheads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Followers of the Lamb are marked in their
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45432:51"/> 
                  <hi>Foreheads</hi> too, chap. 14. ver. 1. <hi>And I looked, and lo a Lamb ſtood on the Mount Sion, and with him</hi> 144000 <hi>having his Fathers Name written in their Foreheads.</hi> But now though the followers of the Lamb are thus mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with their Fathers Name written in their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, yet their mark doth not only conſiſt in ſome thing that is poſitive, but in <hi>Refuſing the mark of the Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 20.—why, but to ſhew thus much, That they are witneſſes upon this account, becauſe they do bear witneſs unto Chriſt, the truth and wayes of Chriſt, in oppoſition to the wayes of Anti-Chriſt. Thus they are conformed unto Jeſus Chriſt, who is the <hi>True and the Faithful witneſs,</hi> Rev. 3. <hi>write, Theſe things ſaith the Amen, the true and Faithful witneſs.</hi> That is, <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Chriſt is the true and the faithful witneſs, and therefore thoſe that are his, they muſt be witneſſes too, that they may be conformed to him.</p>
               <p>Thereby they alſo overcome, as you have it in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. <hi>And they overcame him by the Bloud of the Lamb, and by the word of their teſtimony.</hi> They over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the Bloud of the Lamb, and by the word of their teſtimony, by witneſs-bearing. So then, the Saints and people of God, they are Chriſts witneſſes. In Anti-Chriſtian times, they are Chriſts witneſſes: and if they be thus deſcribed, why then ſhould not we look unto this work eſpecially, Bearing of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the truths and wayes of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This is the work that we are born for: For this cauſe, ſaith Chriſt, was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the World, that I might bear witneſs unto the truth.</p>
               <p>This is the work of our Generation, witneſs-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the truths of Chriſt in oppoſition to the waies of Anti-Chriſt, in Anti-Chriſtian times. This is the work of our Generation.</p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:45432:51"/>
               <p> This is the work which there is a thouſand years of glory and comfort promiſed unto above other things, as you read in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>This is the work, Witneſs-bearing to the truths of Chriſt, in oppoſition to the wayes of Anti-Chriſt. This is the work that hath the Crown and Name of Martyrdom. A Martyr, whats that but a Witneſs. Every witneſs more or leſs, is a Martyr: We take the word only for them that dye, But every witneſs is a Martyr.</p>
               <p>This is that work which ſometimes is neceſſary to Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10. <hi>For with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs, and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto Salvation.</hi> This is the work I ſay therefore that ſometimes is neceſſary unto Salvation.</p>
               <p>And this is that work which Jeſus Chriſt will own, and acknowledg before all the world. <hi>He that confeſſeth me before men, him will I confeſs before my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and all the Angels in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if this be the great work, why ſhould we not all of us look to this work eſpecially, this witneſs-bearing?</p>
               <p>You will ſay, what ſhall I do that I may be found faithful in this witneſs-bearing? what ſhall I do that I may witneſs a good confeſſion in theſe dayes of ours?</p>
               <p>Something by way of Rule—Something by way of means; and yet not long, becauſe I muſt paſs on to other things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 1. Something by way of Rule. Be ſure that your teſtimonies do agree. Though there be 100 Witneſſes about a buſineſs, if their witneſs don't a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, 'twill be of little worth. And now ſo it is, Chriſts Witneſſes this day are divided into many O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and Perſwaſions, but they may agree in the

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>re are three,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John, that bear witneſs in Heaven,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods teſtifying of the truth of Grace. <hi>There are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> theſe bear witneſs of Chriſt, and their witneſs is good,—why<hi>—For theſe three are One,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 7. And ſaith he at the 8. v. <hi>There are three that bear witneſs on earth, the Spirit, and the Water, and the Bloud.</hi> The Spirit: I come to know that I am the child of God by the teſtimony of the Spirit, bearing witneſs with my Spirit that I am the child of God.—And I come to know that I am the child of God by the witneſs of water, by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Sanctification.—And I come to know that I am the child of God by the teſtimony of Bloud, by the teſtimony of my Faith, relying upon the Bloud of Chriſt. <hi>And theſe three agree:</hi> and theſe three agree <hi>in One.</hi> The teſtimony is good, becauſe they agree in one. So in our teſtifying of Chriſt, If our teſtimonies do agree, our teſtimony is good: thats the firſt thing. We have bin too much divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, God knows we have, and he hath puniſht our Diviſions with Diviſions; 'tis time to unite our te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony: If you would bear witneſs, unite your te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you would witneſs a good confeſſion in theſe dayes of ours, then you muſt be willing to own the truth of Chriſt, to own it whenſoever you are called thereunto: 'tis ſaid, our Saviour Chriſt he witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a good Confeſſion before <hi>Pontius Pilate.—</hi>Pray what kind of witneſs was it—was it any long confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or large,—n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut the manner on't was this,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:45432:52"/> when they call'd him before them to give an account of any fact, he left them to prove it. When they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to give an account of the Doctrine that he held, <hi>Art thou the King of the Jews?</hi> then he owned it. He left them to prove the fact, and he owned the truth; ſo ſhould we do. And indeed, if that we be not willing for to own the truth when we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereunto, why how can it be that the mark of the Father ſhould be written upon our Foreheads on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. We read of the followers of the Beaſt, that they received a mark in their <hi>right hands,</hi> and in their <hi>Foreheads</hi> both:—why in the <hi>Forehead,</hi> and why in the <hi>hand?</hi> In the Forehead, ſometimes to wear it openly—And in their right hands, to put it into their pockets, and to hide it. They can own it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and ſometimes they can hide it: but the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the Lamb, they have the mark of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only in their Forehead. Therefore I ſay, If we would witneſs a good Confeſſion, we muſt be willing to own the truth whenſoever we are called thereunto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you would witneſs a good confeſſion in theſe dayes of ours, then you muſt be willing alſo for to ſuffer for the truth of Chriſt. Thoſe that cannot ſuffer for the truth of Chriſt, and run the hazard of a ſuffering, they cannot bear their witneſs fully. See how they go together, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 10. <hi>Here is the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Faith of the Saints.</hi> The <hi>Faith</hi> of the Saints, and their <hi>Patience,</hi> do go together. So in chap. 14. ver. 12. <hi>Here is the Patience of the Saints, here are they that keep the Commandments of God, and the Faith of Jeſus. Patience,</hi> and keeping the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and the Faith of Jeſus, they go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And therefore thats a third thing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you would witneſs a good Confeſſion, then
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:45432:53"/> take heed that when you hav born your teſtimony, you do nothing that may revoke the ſame, either directly or by conſequence. Some bear a good teſtimony to the truths of Chriſt, but then they revoke their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony by ſomthing that they do afterwards, either directly or by conſequence. Mark what is ſaid of <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 20. 'tis ſaid of him, <hi>He confeſſed and denyed not, but confeſſed, I am not the Chriſt.</hi> He confeſſed, and did not revoke his teſtimony. <hi>He confeſſed, &amp; denyed not, but confeſſed.</hi> I know there's an Hebraiſm in it, but theres more than ſo.—And he confeſſed and denyed not: He bare his teſtimony, and did nothing that might revoke that teſtimony, either directly or by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. And therefore if you would bear your te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony for the truth of Chriſt, take heed that when you have given in your teſtimony, you do nothing that may revoke it, either directly or by conſequence. Thus by way of Rule.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly by way of Means. If you would be Faithful in bearing your teſtimony, in bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the truths of Chriſt, in oppoſition to the wayes of Anti-Chriſt: Obſerve what the root is that a good confeſſion grows upon, and labour for to ſtrengthen that.</p>
               <p>Now what is the root that a good confeſſion grows upon, but Faith working by Love.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Faith, I believed, and therefore have I ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Love, Much Water cannot quench Love.</hi> Faith working by Love, is the root that a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion grows upon, and therefore ſtrengthen that.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Labour in the work of Self-denyal, and uſe your ſelf now to deny your ſelf. There are two denyals that you read of in the Goſpel—one <hi>comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> and the other <hi>forbidden,</hi> directly contrary one to another.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:45432:53"/>
               <p> Self-denyal—and denyal of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Self-denyal is commanded, <hi>If any man will be my Diſciple, let him deny himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Denying of Chriſt is forbidden: <hi>He that denyes me before men, him will I deny before my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> The more you deny your ſelves, the leſs you will deny Chriſt: And the more you deny Chriſt, the leſs you deny your ſelves. Will you not deny Chriſt, but witneſs fully to Chriſt, and the truths and wayes of Chriſt; labour now to be found in the wayes of ſelf-denyal, that you may be kept from Chriſt-denyal.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the next place, Take heed that you be not feared or ſcared too much with the ſcare-crowes of the times, but go to God for boldneſs, that you may be emboldned with the boldneſs of the Holy Ghoſt. A timerous fearful Spirit will ſhrink in witneſs-bearing, if God come not in with boldneſs. You may ſee how they would have made <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to have ceaſed from the work of God, even by ſcaring and fearing of him, in <hi>Neh.</hi> 6. <hi>Tobiah</hi> and <hi>Sanball<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t,</hi> they ſend unto him that they might make him ceaſe from the work of God that was in his hand; and they ſay unto him, 'Tis reported that thou haſt appointed to Preach at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaying, There is a King in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and now ſhall it be reported to the King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe words, ver. 7. here they cry out, A Plot, a Plot: But while they cry out a Plot upon <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> the truth is, it was their own Plot. <hi>Then I ſent unto them</hi> (at ver. 8.) <hi>ſaying, There are no ſuch things done as thou ſayeſt, but thou feigneſt them of thine own heart.</hi> They cry A Plot, and they made a Plot.</p>
               <p>Well, what was their Plot?—It was to make him ceaſe from the work of the Lord.—And how did they lay the Plot, ſay they at ver. 9. <hi>For they all made</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:45432:54"/> 
                  <hi>us afraid, ſaying, Their hands ſhall be weakned from the work.</hi> They all made us afraid, v. 13. (ſpeaking of falſe Prophets) <hi>Therefore was he hired, that I ſhould be afraid, and do ſo, and ſin.</hi> And ſaith he, ver. 14. <hi>My God, think thou upon</hi> Tobiah <hi>and</hi> Sanballat, <hi>according to theſe their works, and on the Propheteſs</hi> Noadiah, <hi>and the reſt of the Prophets that would have put me in fear.</hi> This was the way to make <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ceaſe from the work of God that was in his hand, to put him in fear, to ſcare him. And therefore take heed of the ſcares of the time, but go to God for boldneſs, that you may be emboldned with the boldneſs of the Holy Ghoſt. And therefore do but read the fourth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where you find, that when the Apoſtles were threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they returned unto their own company, and fell to Prayer, at ver. 23. And being let go, they went to their own company, and there they fall to Prayer, And they lift up their voice,—And what did they pray for? the great thing that they prayed for in their Prayer, was, That God would give them bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>And now Lord,</hi> ſay they, ver. 29. <hi>Behold their threatnings, and grant unto thy Servants, that with all boldneſs they may ſpeak thy Word.</hi> And what was the Anſwer, ver. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>And when they had prayed, the place was ſhaken where they were aſſembled together, and they were all f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lled with the Holy Ghoſt, and they ſpake the Word of God with boldneſs.</hi> This was the Petition put up, <hi>Behold Lord their threatnings, now give boldneſs to thy Servants.</hi> Preſently God anſwered, and they were filled with the boldneſs of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo they bare their teſtimony. And ſo I ſay, If you would bear your teſtimony in theſe dayes of ours, Take heed of being ſcared and feared with the ſcare-Crowes of the times: But rather go to God, and beg boldneſs of him, that you may be emboldned
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:45432:54"/> with the boldneſs of the Holy Ghoſt; and thus ſhall you do this great work, which is the work that we have to do in this day of ours. And ſo I have done with the firſt thing, why the Saints and people of God are called witneſſes, Namely, becauſe it is their work in Anti-Chriſtian times to bear witneſs to the truths and wayes of Chriſt, in oppoſition to the wayes of Anti-Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But then ſecondly, What are theſe Witneſſes more expreſly in regard of their number, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their quality?</p>
               <p>Firſt in regard of their number, They are two, <hi>And I will give power unto my TWO Witneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Two</hi> is but a <hi>Few,</hi> and yet it is enough to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, For out of the mouths of two or three Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhall every word be eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>Two, a Few, and yet enough. The Note is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Chriſt will alwayes have enough to bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the Old Teſtament, <hi>unleſs the Lord had left us a Remnant,</hi> a <hi>very little</hi> Remnant.</p>
               <p>And in the New Teſtament, <hi>Nevertheleſs there are a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And yet they are enough, Two are enough to bear witneſs unto a thing, they are enough. Chriſt, though he have but few to bear witneſs to his truth, he will alwayes have enough to bear witneſs to his truth in the darkeſt times: in the darkeſt times of Anti-Chriſt.</p>

               <p> What then? though many fall off, and go over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Anti-chriſt's Colours, Chriſt will have enough to bear witneſs: In the 24. of <hi>Matth.</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>Many ſhall be offended;</hi> And <hi>Many ſhall be deceived;</hi> And <hi>the Love of Many ſhall grow cold.</hi> But <hi>[he]</hi> that endures to the end: he doth not ſay, but <hi>They</hi> that endure to the end, but <hi>He.</hi> There is an <hi>He</hi> upon that. <hi>Many</hi> ſhall be deceived, and <hi>Many</hi> ſhall be offended, and the love of <hi>Many</hi> ſhall grow cold. But <hi>He</hi> that ſhall endure to the end; But yet an <hi>He;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why ſhould we be afraid and diſcouraged in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Cauſe of God, and the Affairs of the Church: It may be we think few or none will ſtand in this dark and gloomy day, few or none will ſtand.</p>
               <p>But I pray now, have you caſt up the account, how many are wanting upon the Muſter? In the 14. <hi>Rev.</hi> In the 7th. chap.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Church ſhall not loſe one: In the letter end, here's juſt as many to a One, as was in the beginning. We think few or none will ſtand in theſe daies: So <hi>Eliah</hi> thought <hi>And I only am left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi> but he was deceived: There's 7000. men that will not bow the knee to <hi>Baal.</hi> And ſo we may
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:45432:55"/> think, few or none will ſtand, but we may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, God hath his ſeven thouſands that we know not off. Though but few, yet enough, Chriſt will alwaies have enough to bear witneſs to his Truth in the darkeſt times, Two Witneſſes. This for their Number.</p>
               <p>But then Secondly, As for their qualification.</p>
               <p>For their quality: <hi>Theſe are the two Olive trees,</hi> at the 4. <hi>verſe</hi> (I ſhall ſpeak to all theſe things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of my Doctrine) <hi>And the two Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-ſticks ſtanding before the God of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wat's that? Theſe are the Olive-trees: Why if you look into <hi>Zech.</hi> from whence this is taken, you ſhall find the <hi>two Olive-trees</hi> are the godly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and Miniſters, by whoſe aſſiſtance the golden Oyl is emptied into the Candle-ſticks, and Lamps. Having ſpoken of the Candleſtick of gold, at the 2d. <hi>verſ.</hi> of that 4. of <hi>Zech.</hi> And of two O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live-trees by it; at the 3d. <hi>verſ.</hi> At the 11. <hi>verſe: Then anſwered I, and ſaid unto him, what are theſe two Olive-trees upon the right ſide of the Candleſtick, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the left ſide thereof? And I anſwered again, and ſaid unto him, what be theſe two Olive-branches which through the two golden pipes, empty the golden Oyle out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? And he anſwered me, and ſaid, knoweſt thou not what theſe be? And I ſaid, No my Lord: Then ſaid he, Theſe are the two annointed ones, that ſtand by the Lord of the whole Earth—</hi>The <hi>two annointed ones—</hi>What's that?-Why the Magiſtrates were annointed, and the High-Prieſts were annointed. <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> were the two annointed ones—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſtand by the Lord of the whole Earth.</hi> What's that? that are publick Miniſters. So then, theſe two Olive-trees are the godly Magiſtrate, and the godly Miniſter.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:45432:56"/>
               <p> But what are the two Candleſticks? Theſe are the two Olive-trees, and the two Candleſticks.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour tells you that <hi>the ſeven Golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, are the ſeven Churches.</hi> They were ſeven: Now in Anti-chriſtian times reduced to a leſſer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, two Candleſticks: Though as I ſaid before, Chriſt will loſe none in the latter times, yet in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian times reduced unto two.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the two Candleſticks: Chriſt tells you the Candleſticks are the Churches: So then put this together: Would you know what theſe two Olive trees are and the two Candleſticks? They are the godly Magiſtrate and godly Miniſter in conjunction with the Saints of God and Churches of Chriſt. The two Olive-trees are the godly Magiſtrate and the Miniſtry: The Candleſticks are the Churches and Saints of God. The godly Magiſtrate and Miniſter, in conjunction with the Churches and Saints of God. The godly Magiſtrate alone, is not it: Nor the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry alone, is not it: Nor good people and Saints alone, is not it; Here are two Olive-trees, and two Candleſticks: So that would you know what theſe are? They are the godly Magiſtrate, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, in conjunction with the Saints of God, and Churches of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And then if ſo, That theſe be the Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Here we may ſee who thoſe are that are fit to bear witneſs of Chriſt in Antichriſtian times, to bear their Teſtimony.—They are to be a fruitful, profitable people, And a lightſom people, that can hold forth light unto others in ſome meaſure:—What more fruitful and profitable than the Olive-tree? There's nothing unprofitable; The Bark, Oyl; the Leaf, Oyl; the Body, Oyl; the Fruit, Oyl; nothing unprofitable: So the Saints of God, they
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45432:56"/> are the Sons and Daughters of Oyl, nothing but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. The wicked indeed are compared to the <hi>green Bay-tree;</hi> barren, unprofitable: But the Godly are compared in Scripture to the <hi>Olive-tree,</hi> nothing not profitable: The Wicked are compared to <hi>Goats,</hi> the Saints are compared to <hi>Sheep:</hi> Sheep, nothing not profitable: Their wool profitable, their fleſh profitable; their very dung profitable: Nothing not profitable: And here, the Witneſſes of Chriſt, they are the <hi>Olive-tree;</hi> fruitful, and a profitable people; and a people in ſome meaſure fit to give light to others, as the Candleſtick, to hold forth light unto others.</p>
               <p>Beloved, Truely every one is not fit to bear witneſs to the Cauſe, and the Truths, and the Waies of Jeſus Chriſt: A man may be a Proteſtant, in oppoſition to the Papiſts, and yet an ignorant man; A man may be a Profeſſor, in oppoſition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, and yet barren in his life. No, no, none are fit to bear teſtimony to the Truths of Chriſt, and the Waies of Chriſt, in oppoſition to the waies of Anti-chriſt, but the Olive and the Candleſtick; The <hi>profitable</hi> man and the <hi>lightſom</hi> man: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in evil times that you may be fit to bear witneſs to the Waies of Jeſus Chriſt in oppoſition to the Waies of Anti-chriſt, labour to be Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Oyl; labour to be more fruitful and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in your life; <hi>And let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may glorifie your Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And ſo now I have done with the ſecond thing, What theſe Witneſſes are, More particularly in reſpect of their number, Two; In reſpect of their q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ality, They are two Olive-trees, and two Candleſticks.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But then Thirdly, It it here ſaid that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y ſhall
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45432:57"/> Propheſie 1260. daies, clothed in Sackcloth; that they ſhall lie in Sackcloth, and lie in Sackcloth 1260 daies.</p>
               <p>In Sackcloth,—What's that—And how 1260 daies?</p>
               <p>If you ask what this Sackcloth means: It repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the ſad, and afflicted, and mournful condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Saints and people of God ſhall be in, in Antichriſtian times. When the Jews of old mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and were afflicted, they put on Sackcloth: The Princes put on Sackcloth, and the Prieſts put on Sackcloth, and the people put on Sackcloth: So here, the Witneſſes clothed in Sackcloth;—What doth this mean, but their ſad, and afflicted, and mournful condition? Such it is, and muſt be in Antichriſtian times.</p>
               <p>For is it not a ſad thing, and mournful, for the holy City to be troden underfoot by the Gentiles? ſo it ſhall be in Antichriſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n times.</p>
               <p>Is it not a ſad and mournful thing for the Church of God to be hidden, the inner Court to be hidden? Indeed a hidden Church is a true Church; a ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Flock is a true Flock, and a ſcattered Church is a true Church: But is it not a ſad thing for Churches to be hidden; the Church of God to be hidden? Why ſo it muſt be in Antichriſtian times. I remember Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> ſaith, when the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is in the Wilderneſs, ſhe muſt not think that there will be Congregations ſo viſible; but in a Wilderneſs here and there, or in a Forreſt, here and there is a houſe; and here and there you meet with a man; But you meet not with great Towns, and Corporations in a Wilderneſs, or in a Forreſt: So when the Church is in the Wilderneſs, here and there a knot of Saints, and here and there a knot of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45432:57"/> meeting: But Corporations and Churches then are hidden: Is it not a ſad thing now I ſay? Yet thus it muſt be.</p>
               <p>Is it not a ſad thing for the Veſſels of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be defiled? So it muſt be in Antichriſtian times.</p>
               <p>Is it not a ſad thing for the ſolemn Aſſemblies to lie under reproach? So it is and muſt be in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian times.</p>
               <p>Is it not a ſad thing for the Saints and People of God, and the Daughters and Sons of <hi>Sion</hi> to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted to the very Gates of <hi>Sion,</hi> yea into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gates of their Trade? So it is and muſt be in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian times: and therefore no wonder that the Witneſſes lie in Sackcloth.</p>
               <p>But then they lie in Sackcloth 1260 daies, —what's that? That is 1260 years, a day being put for a year, as it is ordinary in Scripture.</p>
               <p>And if you ask, When doth this time begin, or end, that we may know where we are?</p>
               <p>I anſwer: If you can find the beginning from whence this time doth commence, you will ſoon find the end: —now theſe 1260 daies or years, are all one with the 42 Months (ſpoken of before) that the Gentiles ſhall tread down the holy City: They are all one with the 42 months of the Beaſt. Take a day for a year, and 42 months come to 1260 years; take a day for a month, and then 1260 daies comes to 42 months.</p>
               <p>Theſe 42 months of the Beaſt then, and the 1260 daies or years that the Witneſſes are clothed in Sackcloth are all one.</p>
               <p>Now, when did the 42 months of the Beaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin?</p>
               <p>In likelyhood about the year 400 or 406 or 10
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45432:58"/> or thereabouts, for to ſpeak to a year or ſo, is not ſafe, Chronologers have been deceived: I ſay in the year of our Lord 400, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>For look when that that hinders was taken away, then the man of ſin was diſcovered: The miſtery of iniquity did work in the Apoſtles time: In 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. <hi>The myſtery of iniquity doth already work</hi> verſe 7. <hi>Only he who now letteth, will let until he be taken out of the way, and then ſhall that wicked one be revealed:—</hi>When is that? As <hi>Jerom</hi> and all agree, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire was the thing that let, and about thoſe times was the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire taken out of the way; In 410. the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> broke in upon <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, about that time was that that let taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, (I do but touch upon this, and touch I muſt upon it) look when the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire did fall aſunder into ten Kingdoms, then did the Beaſt begin his forty two months, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 12. <hi>And the ten horns which thou ſaweſt are ten Kings, which have received no Kingdom as yet, But receive power as Kings one hour with the Beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when did the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire fall aſunder into ten Kingdoms? About the year 400. 'Tis obſerved by good Hiſtorians, and divers, that in the year 406. <hi>Brittany</hi> and theſe Nations fell off from the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, to be a Kingdom ſtanding by it ſelf.—Now then, if the time did begin about 400. ſurely the end of the time we muſt needs be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. I confeſs indeed: It is a ſad thing for Chriſt's Witneſſes to lie in Sackcloth; and to lie in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth 1260. years, but ſo it muſt be, not a day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, but to a year, to a day. Why ſhould you be offended friends then, at the Sackcloth and mourning condition of the Church, and Saints, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:45432:58"/> People of God?—Why, is not this the habit of the Witneſſes, <hi>Sackcloth:</hi> and will not you be content to be habited as they are habited, as Chriſt's Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are habited, to wear the ſame clothes that Chriſt's Witneſſes do? And if Chriſt's Witneſſes ſhall lie in Sackcloth 1260. years, will not you be contented to be in Sackcloth three or four years? Chriſtians, will not you be contented to be in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth three or four years? Me thinks we ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther look to the duty of a Sackcloth condition; there ſhould our hearts and our thoughts be: But we are very apt evermore, (and conſider what I ſay, not only in reference to this point, but to others) we are very apt to mind Gods work, and neglect our own: 'Tis Gods work to ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>l the Promiſe, 'tis our work to apply the Promiſe; but we mind the fulfilling on't, and neglect the applying on't; mind Gods work, and neglect our own work!</p>
               <p>'Tis Gods work to deliver his people, 'tis their work to be humbled under the mighty hand of God: But we mind deliverance, which is Gods work, and neglect our own work, humiliation under the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hand of God.</p>
               <p>'Tis Gods work (ſaith the Martyr) to <hi>take care,</hi> 'tis our work to <hi>caſt care: Caſt all your care upon God;</hi> there's your work: <hi>for he careth for you,</hi> that's Gods work. To take care is Gods work, to caſt care is our work, but we mind Gods work, and are tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing care, and neglect our own work, which is to caſt all our care upon God.</p>
               <p>'Tis Gods work to take off our Sackcloth, 'tis our work to wear it; but we mind Gods work, the taking of it off: When ſhall this Sackcloth be off? and neglect our own work, to wear it handſomly.—Why ſhould we not I ſay, mind our buſineſs?
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:45432:59"/> what is the duty of a Sackcloth condition more?</p>
               <p>Why then, when we are in Sackcloth, ſurely then 'tis our duty for to lay by our Ornaments: <hi>Let the Bridegroom go out of his Chamber,</hi> in the day of Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth; if any body may rejoyce, the Bridegroom may; But let the Bridegroom go forth of his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in a Sackcloth day: Lay aſide your Ornaments friends, lay aſide your Ornaments: In the time of Sackcloth, 'tis our duty then for to faſt and pray, and cry mightily unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>Then 'tis our duty to put our mouths in the duſt, if ſo be there may be hope.</p>
               <p>Then it is our duty for to bear our Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>Then it is our duty for to wait on God; though the Witneſſes wear Sackcloth for a time, yet there are white Robes provided for them, and they come out with Palms in their hands.</p>
               <p>And the nearer the time of Deliverance grows, the leſs time for waiting, the more we are ingag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to wait: Why now according to the calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is not much of the time to come; there is but a little of the Sackcloth time to come, ſhall we not watch with him one hour, and wear Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth with him one hour? wait a while, he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry. And ſo I have done with the third thing; namely, what this Sackcloth is, and their lying in Sackcloth for 1260. years.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But then in the fourth place, It is ſaid here, that theſe Witneſſes did Propheſie: <hi>I will give power unto my two Witneſſes, and they ſhall Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pheſie—</hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie—What's that? and how did it come to paſs, that they ſhall Propheſie in the time of their Sackcloth.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:45432:59"/>
               <p> Propheſie,—What's that?</p>
               <p>Why Propheſying is ſometimes taken in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the Revelation of the mind of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man doth foretel things to come, and ſo <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and others were called Prophets.</p>
               <p>Sometimes Propheſying is taken more largely in Scripture, for Preaching the Word of God in a way of Office; Preaching the Word by Office: And ſo the Miniſters and Preachers of the Word of God in Office, they are called Prophets in Scripture.</p>
               <p>But Thirdly, yet more largely: Propheſie is took for a declaring and making known of the Mind and Will of God, and ſo all thoſe that do declare and make known the Mind and Will of Jeſus Chriſt, they are ſaid to be Prophets, and ſo I take it here: For I pray do but mark, This their Propheſying and Witneſs-bearing ſeems to be all one: I will give power unto my two Witneſſes, and they ſhall Propheſie:—And when they ſhall have finiſhed their Teſtimony, their witneſs bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; He ſhould have ſaid, when they have finiſhed their <hi>Propheſie:</hi> True, But he would ſhew that their <hi>Witneſs-bearing</hi> and <hi>Propheſie</hi> is all one; And ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare chap. 19. and chap. 22. of the <hi>Revelations</hi> together, and you will find the ſame, <hi>I fell at his feet and worſhipped him, and he ſaid unto me, ſee thou do it not, I am thy fellow ſervant, and of thy Brethren, that have the teſtimony of Jeſus:</hi> and <hi>chap.</hi> 22. I fell at his feet, and he ſaid unto me ſee thou do it not, for I am thy fellow ſervant, and of thy <hi>Brethren the Prophets; Of thy Brethren the Prophets,</hi> here in <hi>chap.</hi> 22. is all one, <hi>with thy Brethren that have the Teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> In the 19th. and ſaith he there, <hi>Worſhip God, for the Teſtimony of Jeſus, is the Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie:</hi> It's the ſame word that's uſed, when they had
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45432:60"/> finiſhed their <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> or <hi>Witneſs-bearing: The witneſs of Jeſus, is the Spirit of Propheſie:</hi> This bearing witneſs to the truths of Jeſus, this is Propheſie: And thus now the Witneſſes, they are ſaid to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie.</p>
               <p>Well, but how come they to Propheſie in the times of their Sackcloth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behold, I will give power unto my two Witneſſes, and they ſhall Propheſie</hi> 1260. <hi>daies clothed in Sackcloth:</hi> How comes it to paſs that they ſhall Propheſie in Sackcloth?</p>
               <p>It's clearly anſwered, <hi>I will give power</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) I will give power unto my two Witneſſes, and they ſhall Propheſie in Sackcloth. I will give power to them; they ſhall have their Orders to Preach from my ſelf; They ſhall have power from Me to Preach and to Propheſie, and to bear their Teſtimony: Some have their Orders and their Power to Propheſie from Men; from Prelates, from the Beaſt; but (ſaith he) <hi>I will give power unto my two Witneſſes</hi> to Propheſie: It's ſaid of the Beaſt, That Power <hi>was given him:</hi> It's ſaid of the Witneſſes, <hi>I will give Power unto my two Witneſſes:</hi> They ſhall have their Orders, they ſhall have their Power of Propheſie and Witneſs-bearing from my ſelf: I will give Power unto my two Witneſſes. Plainly then thus much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> There's none can bear witneſs to the Truths of Jeſus Chriſt, but thoſe that are impowred by Chriſt, and if that Jeſus Chriſt will give power unto his two Witneſſes for to Propheſie, and to bear their Teſtimony, then why ſhould we not depend on God? why ſhould we not go unto Chriſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on Chriſt, for our very Power to bear Witneſs to the Truths of Chriſt.</p>

               <p> It may be you are afraid, and you will ſay thus: I am a poor weak Creature, man or woman, and I ſhall never be able for to bear a Teſtimony in theſe witneſs-bearing times?</p>
               <p>I but you know what the Martyr ſaid, I'le ſet my foot againſt the <note place="margin">Alce Driver.</note> foot of the proudeſt Prelate of them all in the cauſe of Chriſt: But who gave power unto her;—Jeſus Chriſt that ſaith, I will give power unto my two Witneſſes; and he hath ſaid ſo concerning all his Witneſſes: I will give power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my two Witneſſes, that they ſhall Propheſie, and bear witneſs; and he is faithful: and therefore why ſhould you not go to Chriſt, and lay your ſelves flat upon this Promiſe, and ſay to him: O Lord, I am a poor weak Creature; I fear I ſhall never be able for to bear my Teſtimony, but thou haſt ſaid, I will give power unto my two Witneſſes; I am one of thy Witneſſes: Now then O Lord, give power to me, for I am poor; O remember this Promiſe, here's a gracious and a bleſſed Promiſe: Chriſt ſaith himſelf, I will give power unto my two Witneſſes, and he is faithful, and will make it good. And ſo I have done with the fourth thing, namely, what Propheſying is, and how the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes come to Propheſie in the times of their Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth; Chriſt gives them power.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But then Fifthly, what is the defence and guard that theſe Witneſſes have, whereby they are guarded and defended in their Propheſie.</p>
               <p>The Text ſaith, If any man will hurt them, fire Proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies:—What's that? Fire proceedeth out of their mouth; It may relate unto <hi>Moſes;</hi> but eſpecially it relates unto <hi>Elijah,</hi> a Prophet, a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:45432:61"/> that when the Captain and his fifty came to do him hurt, he called for fire from Heaven, and deſtroyed the Captain and his fifty; fire came out of his mouth by his prayers: and when another Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain came, and his fifty, <hi>Elijah</hi> prayed, and fire came down and deſtroyed him and his fifty: Fire came out of his mouth; plainly it relates to this of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What then is this fire that proceeds out of the month of the Witneſſes, but the ſcorching and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Judgements of God, whereby the Enemies of Gods people are blaſted and deſtroyed by the prayers and threatnings of the people of God, that come out of their mouth.</p>
               <p>But if any man will hurt them, mind a little.</p>
               <p>It ſeems then firſt, That there will alwaies be ſome in readineſs to hurt the witneſſing people of Chriſt, though they be impowered to witneſs from Chriſt himſelf. Though the Saints and People of God be impowered by Chriſt himſelf for to bear their Teſtimony: There will alwaies be ſome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hurt the witneſſing people of God. <hi>If any man will hurt them,</hi> Them that are Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, though men do hurt the witneſſing people of God, they ſhall not go unpuniſhed: <hi>If any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouths, and devoureth their enemies:</hi> Though the enemies may hurt the witneſſing people of Chriſt, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhall be hurt themſelves, they ſhall not go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed.</p>
               <p>But Thirdly, They ſhall not only be puniſhed that hurt the witneſſing people of God: But they ſhall be puniſhed with a So; He muſt <hi>in this manner,</hi> or So, he muſt <hi>So</hi> be puniſhed:—So—how ſo? <hi>So,</hi> look in what way he thought to have hurt the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:45432:61"/> witneſſing people of God: <hi>So</hi> ſhall he be hurt, look by what mens he ſought to hurt the people of God, by the ſame hand and means ſhall he be hurt himſelf.</p>
               <p>But <hi>So,</hi> ſo by fire coming out of their mouth; by the prayers of the people of God, they ſhall be blaſted and conſumed; not by ſword, not by might, nor by ſtrength, but by <hi>fire</hi> coming out of their mouth, <hi>So,</hi> So, he ſhall not only be puniſhed, but be puniſhed with a <hi>ſo,</hi> that hurts the witneſſing people of God.</p>
               <p>Oh my beloved friends, why do you ſhut your mouths? why ſhould you not be much in prayer? what doth fire come out of the mouth of the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing people of God to devour their enemies, and will you ſhut your mouth, and not pray?</p>
               <p>Oh! where will Oppoſers appear; what will become of thoſe that hurt the witneſſing people of God, O wo to them?</p>
               <p>Oh! what a dangerous thing is it to oppoſe the prayers of the people of God? This is the fire that comes out of their mouth, whereby thoſe that hurt them are ſcorched: And therefore let men take heed how they hurt any of the witneſſing people of Chriſt; and let all thoſe that are witneſſes pray; You that are witneſſes now open your mouths, for fire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of your mouths, to devour the enemies that hurt the witneſſing people of God; Open your mouths wide. And ſo I have done with the fifth thing; The Guard whereby the Witneſſes are guarded in the daies of their Propheſie.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſixth thing remains, and that is, what are the great things that theſe Witneſſes will do, in the end of the daies of their Propheſie, and of their Sackcloth.</p>
               <p>Why briefly thus: In the general 'tis ſaid: <hi>Theſe</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:45432:62"/> 
                  <hi>have power to ſmite the Earth with all plagues, as often as they will:</hi> That is, as I humbly conceive, pouring out the ſeven Vials, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. the ſeven Vials are poured out upon the earth: and why is it ſpoken of here, That they have power to ſmite the earth with all Plagues? But to ſhew that at leaſt ſome of the Vials ſhall be poured out, before the Witneſſes are ſlain: But not to fix there, more particularly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Theſe have a power to ſhut Heaven, that it rain not, in the daies of their Propheſie: What's that? Certainly, it muſt relate unto <hi>Elijah:</hi> That <hi>Elijah</hi> prayed, and by his prayer he ſhut the Heavens that it rained not for three years and an half: Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it relates unto <hi>Elijah</hi> as can be: <hi>Elijah</hi> prayed, and by his prayer he ſhut the Heavens that it rained not for three years and a half.</p>
               <p>Well, but what are the Heavens here?</p>
               <p>Thoſe cannot be underſtood litterally, but ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: As it is ſaid in the 8th <hi>verſe, Their dead bodies ſhall lie in the ſtreet of the great City, which Spiritually is called</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Egypt: The Heavens here can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be underſtood litterally, but ſpiritually; what then? what are the Heavens then, and what is the ſhutting of the Heavens that it rain not.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Heavens</hi> are the higheſt power, ſo that look when the Witneſſes have power to reſtrain the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt power in Church and State from their wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed influence; then is this word fulfilled, that they have power to ſhut Heaven that it rain not in the days of their Propheſie: I ſay the Heavens are the higheſt powers: look when the Witneſſes do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the higheſt power in Church and State from their wonted influence, Then is this word ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They have power alſo to turn water
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:45432:62"/> into blood. What's that? plainly it muſt relate to <hi>Moſes,</hi> who turned Rivers, and turned waters into blood: What's that? It cannot be underſtood lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, but ſpiritually ſtill: What's that then? Why thus: Theſe waters are to be underſtood ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, and ſo you read in <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. The Sea, and Rivers were turned into blood: Look therefore when the Witneſſes ſhall have power to turn the ſtill waters of a State or Nation into War and Blood; Then is this Word fulfilled.</p>
               <p>But how came the Witneſſes to have power to do this?</p>
               <p>It may be, not legally, for it is not ſaid here, <hi>And I will give power</hi> unto them to ſhut the Heavens: but theſe <hi>have power</hi> to ſhut the Heavens, and theſe <hi>have power</hi> to turn waters into blood; 'tis not ſaid here, <hi>I will give</hi> them power, as 'tis ſaid before: it may be this may be done, and not legally.</p>
               <p>But when ſhall this be done?</p>
               <p>It muſt be done immediately before their ſlaying. I pray mark the coherence here: They ſhall have power to ſhut the Heavens immediately before they are ſlain, and to turn water into blood imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before they are ſlain, juſt before the three years and a half, that they lye dead upon the earth: For when did <hi>Elijah</hi> ſhut the Heavens but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before the three years and a half of drought: When did <hi>Moſes</hi> turn the waters into blood, but immediately before the coming out of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> So here, immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Witneſſes are ſlain, and they lye three years and a half as dead, immediately before, they have power to ſhut the Heavens that it rain not, and to turn waters into blood.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:45432:63"/>
               <p> Now therefore to draw to a Concluſion; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you ſee all theſe things come to paſs. I will not apply them to times or places, this or that time or place: But when you ſhall ſee all theſe things come to paſs, one treading upon the heel of another: when you ſhall ſee that the Witneſſes have power to ſhut the Heavens that it rain not: to reſtrain the higheſt powers both in Church and State from their wonted influence. And that they have power to turn water into bloud, and ſtill Nations into War; and then immediately upon it they ſhall be ſlain, and ſo lye dead, deprived of their functions and vital opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as if they lay dead. Then lift up your heads, and comfortably ſay, hopefully ſay, Now, now comes the three years and half, which is the laſt time: Now is our Salvation near, for God will bring near his righteouſneſs, and his Salvation ſhall not tarry. And he will place Salvation in <hi>Sion,</hi> for <hi>Iſrael</hi> his glory.</p>
               <p>Only for the preſent, let me conclude and leave an Exhortation with you, which I will draw up from all which hath bin ſaid.</p>
               <p>The firſt part on't is this: The Saints and people of God in Anti-Chriſtian times, they are Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, be ſure that you bear your teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony faithfully. Be faithful now in your Witneſs-bearing, Chriſtians. Chriſt will pay all the charge that you are at in Witneſs-bearing. If a man have a Suit at Law, and have five or ſix Witneſſes, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them a hundred Miles, he bears all the charge of their Witneſs-bearing. Saith Chriſt, I will give power to <hi>My</hi> Witneſſes, they are <hi>My</hi> Witneſſes. Ye are Chriſts Witneſſes, and look whatſoever charge you are at, he will bear the charge, he will bear all the charge of your Witneſs-bearing: And if your Faith come not home enough, as it ſhould be, yet
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:45432:63"/> Chriſt is Faithful though we believe not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be faithful in your Witneſs-bearing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though you be but few, be not afraid, be not diſcouraged, for Chriſt will alwaies have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to bear Witneſs to his truth in the darkeſt times.-Comfort ye one another with thoſe words.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Be fruitful as the Olive tree; And be lightſome as the Candleſtick. O that God would roul away the reproach of a barren heart from every one of you, and of a barren life. Tis time now to be fruitful that you may be as the Olive-Tree, and as the Candleſtick, to hold forth your light to others.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Pray now have a care that you wear your Sackcloth handſomly. Truly theſe Meetings that now we do enjoy, they have a Sack-cloth on them: there is a Sack-cloth upon the loyns of every ſuch meeting as this. Chriſtians, you have your Sack-cloth on, pray wear your Sack-cloth handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for in due time you ſhall have Robes, you ſhall come forth in white Robes, having your Palmes in your hands, only for the preſent wear your Sack-cloth handſomly. I mean, carry your ſad and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful condition as you ought.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If you find that you be not able for to bear your teſtimony as you would, and as you ſhould: Go then to Chriſt, and remember this promiſe, <hi>I will give power unto my Two VVitn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſes.</hi> O plead this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe Chriſtians, it is a great promiſe: <hi>I will give power unto my two VVitneſſes.</hi> Though men take away power from you for Propheſy; They will not let you Pray, nor Propheſie, yet <hi>I will give power.]</hi> I will give power in oppoſition to your own weakneſs. And I will give power in oppoſition to mens Malice. Therefore go to Chriſt and preſs this promiſe, Lord, I am one of thy poor Witneſſes, therefore give pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:45432:64"/> according to thy Word, for thou haſt ſaid I will give power, and they ſhall Propheſie.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Let not your mouth be ſhut, but open in Prayer: For it is ſaid here, If any man will hurt them, Fire proceedeth out of his mouth. That was the Prayer of <hi>Elijah,</hi> It brought dovvn fire, ſcorching and blaſting Judgments. Chriſtians, is there a Fire, a Fire in your mouth? O you that have any credit in Heaven, pray now. If there were any here that I could ſpeak to, I would ſay thus, You that never prayed, pray now: but I hope there is none ſuch; but if there ſhould be any ſuch, I would ſay, you that never prayed, pray now; and you that have any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in Heaven, improve it in this day of tryal for the poor Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>And to conclude all: If that you ſhould ſee that the Witneſſes ſhall have done ſuch great things, that they have ſhut Heaven that it rain not; that they have turned water into bloud, and yet immediately upon it they have bin ſlain, and lye dead: If you ſee all theſe things come to paſs one after another, then lift up your heads oh ye Saints, and wait, and wait; for he that doth come, will come, and will not tarry. And when he comes, he will not only pay you your principle-money, but he vvill pay you all your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance money too: And therefore what I ſay to one, I ſay unto you all, and to my ovvn ſoul, Let us wait upon the Lord and keep his vvay. And thus novv I have done with the firſt time of the Witneſſes, their Propheſying time, their ſlaying time follovvs: But that you will conjecture at ſomthing by what hath bin ſaid.</p>

For the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, theſe ſeveral things will fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our conſideration:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That a good man may make uſe of the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though he may make uſe of the World, yet he muſt uſe the World as if he uſed it not.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What are thoſe particular concernments wherein we are to uſe the World as if we uſed it not.</p>
               <p>Fourthly what there is in theſe Reaſons of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>The ſhortneſs of the time,</hi> and the <hi>paſſing faſhion of the world,</hi> that ſhould move us ſo to uſe the World, as if we uſed it not.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, When a man may be ſaid ſo to uſe the World as if he uſed it not.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, What is the iſſue and the conſequence thereof, in caſe he do or do not.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, What a man ſhould do that he may get his heart into this holy frame, So to uſe the World as if he uſed it not.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, We muſt grant that a good man may make uſe of the World; he may make uſe of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:45432:65"/> the world in reference to the <hi>perſons</hi> of the world, in reference to the <hi>things</hi> of the world.</p>
               <p>In regard of the <hi>perſons</hi> of the world: So <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> did make uſe of <hi>Abimelech;</hi> ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> did make uſe of <hi>Laban;</hi> ſo the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did make uſe of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> did make uſe of the Heathen <hi>Cyrus, Darius, Artaxerxes,</hi> for the building of the Houſe of God. Plainly then, a good man may make uſe of the world, the <hi>perſons</hi> of the world.</p>
               <p>And as he may make uſe of the <hi>perſons</hi> of the world, ſo he may make uſe of the <hi>things</hi> of the world, for they are his own: <hi>All things are yours, whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollo, <hi>things preſent, and things to come; life and death, all things are yours.</hi> And who may not make uſe of his own? If a friend ſhould ſend a man a gift, it would be accounted an inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and unthankfulneſs not to make uſe thereof. Why truly, as for the things of this world, they are Gods gift; <hi>The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh:</hi> They are Gods gift: And will it not be accounted an incivility towards God, and an unthankfulneſs towards God, not to make uſe of this his gift that he hath given us: May not a Traveller make uſe of thoſe things in his journey, that are meet and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for him in his journey? he may. We are all Travellers to another Country, we are upon our journey, ſo far therefore as things are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for our journey, we may make uſe thereof: The Lord would have <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf to be imployed in the ſtate of Innocency, in the things of the world, <hi>Six daies ſhalt thou labour, and do all that thou haſt to do:</hi> And the Apoſtle in his ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> Chap. 3. v. 11. ſhews, that thoſe are <hi>buſie-bodies,</hi> whoſe bodies are not buſie: <hi>We hear that</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:45432:66"/> 
                  <hi>there are ſome which walk among you diſorderly, working not at all, but are buſie bodies;</hi> working not at all, but work in anothers ground: <hi>buſie bodies, becauſe their bodies are not buſie:</hi> See how they go here together, working not at all, but are at work where they ſhould not work: thoſe whoſe bodies are not buſie, will be buſie bodies: And is it not an evil thing to be a buſie body? 'tis ſo; therefore we muſt work: How can we work if we do not make uſe of the world, and the things thereof? So that plainly then we ſee the firſt thing clear'd: A good man may make uſe of the world, both in reference to the <hi>perſons</hi> of the world, and in reference to the <hi>things</hi> of the world: A good man may make uſe of the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, though we may make uſe of the world, we muſt uſe the world as though we uſed it not, not regarding it too much, not ſetting our affections upon it too much, not ſpending too much time upon the world, and the things thereof.</p>
               <p>For look as wicked men do uſe the things of God, and of the other world, ſo a good man ſhould uſe the things of this world: Why now a wicked man doth uſe the things of God, as if he us'd them not, pray, as if he prayed not, and hear, as if he heard not; why, becauſe his mind is upon other things: Why truly ſo the minds of the Saints are, or ſhould be, upon other things. <hi>Set your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on things that are above:</hi> 'Tis a good ſpeech that an Antient hath, ſaith he, <hi>As good men are, where they yet are not, namely in heaven; ſo they are not where they now are, namely on earth, for your converſation is in heaven:</hi> Though your communication be here on earth, yet your converſation is in heaven; and if heaven be our <hi>object,</hi> earth will be our <hi>abject:</hi> Few I confeſs that live at this rate, to uſe the world as if
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:45432:66"/> they us'd it not: But is there not reaſon, good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it? let's ſee the reaſons: Is there not good reaſon for it? yes. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, If the world, and the things thereof be ſo our own, as if they were not our own; then why ſhould we not uſe the world, and the things thereof, as if we us'd them not? why now, though the things of the world are our own in regard of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, yet if you look into the ſixteenth of <hi>Luke,</hi> you will find that they are called <hi>not our own,</hi> ver. 11. <hi>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous Mammon, who will commit to your truſt the true riches? and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another mans, who will give you that which is your own:</hi> That which is <hi>another mans,</hi> that's the ſame with the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Mammon;</hi> who ſhall give unto you that which is your own? <hi>ſpiritual</hi> things are our <hi>own;</hi> the things of God are here call'd our <hi>own;</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that is our own which we can carry up and down with us, <hi>omnia mea mecum porto,</hi> that is our own which we can carry away with us, out of the world with us, that's truly our own: But now, as for the things of this world, they have <hi>wings,</hi> yea <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>they make themſelves wings:</hi> If you clip their wings they will grow again; they make themſelves wings, and fly away; and they have the wing of an <hi>Eagle,</hi> ſtrong wings for to fly away. Now if that the things of this world be ſo our own, as if they were not our own, why ſhould we not uſe the world, as if we us'd it not?</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the things of this world be, and are as if they were not, why ſhould we not uſe them as if we us'd them not? In the 23 of the <hi>Proverbs, Solomon</hi> ſaith, that they <hi>are not, why ſhouldeſt thou let thine eyes fly upon that which is not.</hi> They are not, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:45432:67"/> if that they be as if they were not, why ſhould we not uſe them as if we us'd them no?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If it be not in the power of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this world for to <hi>help</hi> us, or to <hi>hurt</hi> us, to do either good or evil to us, why then ſhould we not uſe the world as if we us'd it not? you know, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 62. 10. <hi>If riches encreaſe, ſet not your hearts upon them;</hi> why, <hi>God hath ſpoken once, twice, and I heard it, that power belongs to God:</hi> 'Tis not in the power of riches, or any creature in the world, to do us either hurt or help. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. its made Gods Prerogative; <hi>Shew the things that are to come hereafter,</hi> v. 23. <hi>That we may know that ye are Gods, do good, or do evil;</hi> do good, or do evil: if ye will ſhew your ſelves O ye Idols to be Gods, then do good, or do evil; this is Gods great Prerogative, to help, or to hurt, its Gods prerogative, 'tis not in the power of any creature for to help, or hurt; now if it be not in the power of any creature for to help, or hurt, why ſhould we not uſe the world, and the things thereof, as if we us'd them not?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We are ſo to uſe the world, and the things thereof, as they are; why now truly there is nothing in this world that is either good or evil mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, but as it is uſed; proſperity in it ſelf is not good, not morally good; adverſity in it ſelf is not evil, 'tis not morally evil; all the things of this world are but indifferent, neither <hi>good</hi> nor <hi>evil</hi> in themſelves, but as they are uſed: Thus then, if all the things of this world are but in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indifferent, neither <hi>good</hi> nor <hi>evil,</hi> why ſhould not our hearts be carried out indifferently towards them, and ſo to uſe them, as if we us'd them not?</p>
               <p>All the things of this world, they are but to ſerve a turn, they are not to be enjoyed for themſelves,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:45432:67"/> only for to ſerve a turn; there is nothing that you have to deal withall, but is meerly for to ſerve a turn; <hi>Cloaths</hi> are but to ſerve a turn, to cover na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs; <hi>good meat and drink</hi> is but to ſerve a turn, to ſerve our hunger, and our thirſt; <hi>money,</hi> and <hi>hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and <hi>lands,</hi> are all but to ſerve a turn, <hi>only God is to be enjoyed;</hi> God is not for to ſerve a turn, but all the things of this world, they are only for to ſerve a particular turn: The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> therefore have a handſome ſpeech of a worldly man, they deforibe him, <hi>He doth enjoy what he ſhould uſe, and he doth uſe what he ſhould enjoy: God</hi> is to be enjoyed, and he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes him; the <hi>world</hi> is to be uſed, and he enjoys that: but 'tis <hi>God alone</hi> that is to be enjoyed for himſelf; all things here are but to ſerve a turn, and therefore why ſhould we not uſe the world as if we us'd it not.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If the world do uſe us, as if it us'd us not, and if the world do care for us, as if it car'd not for us, why ſhould not we uſe the world as if we us'd it not? <hi>Paul</hi> reaſons after this manner, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory, ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom</hi> (or whereby) <hi>the world is crucified unto me; and I unto the world.</hi> The world looks upon me as a man hang'd, crucified, hanged out of the way, why truly I look upon the world ſo too, ſaith he; the world looks upon me as a dry leaf, and I look upon the world as a dry leaf. Thus now it is, the world cares for us, as if it car'd not for us, and the world uſes us, as if it us'd us not; and therefore why ſhould not we uſe the world as if we us'd it not.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>I but</hi> Solomon <hi>ſaith, Whatſoever thou findeſt in thine hand to do, do it with all thy might.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> True, and it is in our band to uſe the world,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:45432:68"/> as if we us'd it not; and therefore this we are to do with all our might, even to uſe the world as if we us'd it not: And ſo I have done with the ſecond thing; though a good man may make uſe of the world, and the things thereof, yet he is to uſe the world, as if he us'd it not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I but then thirdly, what are thoſe particular concernments wherein we are to uſe the world as if we us'd it not? why, the Apoſtle here doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in four.</p>
               <p>In the matter of our <hi>Relations; it remaineth that they that have wives, be as though they had none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the matter of our <hi>grief; And they that weep, as though they wept not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the matter of our <hi>joy; And they that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the matter of our <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſeſſions; And they that buy, as though they poſſeſſed not.</hi> I ſhall run through them briefly, that we may have the clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the caſe, and the matter before us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As for the matter of our Relations, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>It remaineth, that both they that have wives, be as though they had none:</hi> A man may uſe his Relations, as if he had none; His Relations:</p>
               <p>Why, but is not a man to provide for his wife, and children, and family?</p>
               <p>Yes, he is worſe than an Infidel that provideth not for his Wife, and for his Family, for his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But when a man hath Relations, he is very apt to be loſt therein; a man may be drunk with his own Bear or Wine: <hi>I have married a Wife, and I cannot come;</hi> therefore he is to uſe his Relations as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f he had none, in regard of his care to pleaſe God; as diligent in frequenting the means of grace, as if he had no Relations: For, ſaith he, v. 32.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:45432:68"/> 
                  <hi>But I would have you without carefulneſs, he that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may pleaſe the Lord: He that is married, careth for the things that are of the world, how he may pleaſe his wife.</hi> In reference therefore unto the pleaſing of God, frequenting of the means of grace, let him that hath Relations be as if he had none, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred no more by them, than if he had none.</p>
               <p>Let him be as zealous for the truth, as if he had none.</p>
               <p>Let him be as apt, and ready to ſuffer for the Cauſe of Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt, as if he had none: We are apt to boggle at ſufferings, becauſe of our Relations; What ſhall become of my wiſe and children? What ſhall become of my Family? It was a Speech therefore of <hi>Origen,</hi> when he was young, unto his Father, when his Father was to go and ſuffer Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome for the Cauſe of Chriſt; <hi>O my Father,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>O my Father, Take heed that you do not bauk this ſuffering for my ſake, that you may provide for me.</hi> We are very apt to bauk ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fferings for the Cauſe of Chriſt, upon the account of our Family, and upon the account of our Relations; but now, let him that hath <hi>Relations</hi> be as if he had none, frequenting and uſing of the means of grace, praying, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing, as if he had none; as zealous for the truth, as if he had none; as apt and ready to ſuffer for the Cauſe of Chriſt, as if he had none. Thus we are to uſe the world as if we us'd it not, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to this concernment: (I muſt but touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things.)</p>
               <p>Secondly, As for the matter of <hi>grief,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>And they that weep, as though they wept not.</hi> 'Tis lawful to grieve and weep, not only for our ſins, but for the miſery of the times: <hi>O that my head</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:45432:69"/> 
                  <hi>were waters, and that mine eyes were a fountain of tears, that I could weep day and night for the ſlaughters. Mine eyes run down with rivers of tears,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, becauſe they keep not thy Law.</hi> God hath a bottle to keep all theſe Pearls in; the tears of his people, they are precious, and too precious to be loſt: As God hath a bag for all the ſins of the wicked to keep them in, ſo he hath a bottle for all the tears of the Saints; but yet we muſt not weep too much, but grieve as if we grieved not.</p>
               <p>Or otherwiſe it will argue that we have too much love to the world: Love is the cauſe of grief; the more paſſionately you grieve for any outward thing, the more abundantly you ſhew your love thereunto, and it will in ſome meaſure reflect upon your God: 'Tis a conſiderable ſpeech that of a child, when the mother of the child had us'd to ſay upon al her loſſes, <hi>Yet my God lives;</hi> when ſhe had loſt a child, ſhe would ſay, yet my God's alive; when ſhe had loſt a friend, yet my God's alive: At laſt, looſing a child ſhe loved much, ſhe wept very much, and another of her children came unto her and ſaid, <hi>Mother, is your God dead?</hi> Mother, is not your God alive? She uſed to ſay ſtill, yet my God's alive, and now weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much, and not ſaying ſo, the child ſaid, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is not your God alive? Truly this grieving much, it hath ſuch a reflexion as this, Is not your God alive? Chriſtians, is not your God alive? you know what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and again I ſay rejoyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If that we are to rejoyce in the Lord evermore, then ſurely we are to weep as if we wept not, and to grieve as if we grieved not: And thus we are to uſe the world as if we us'd it not, in reference to this concernment, the matter of our grief.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:45432:69"/>
               <p> Thirdly, As for the matter of our joy, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>And let them that rejoyce, be as though they rejoyced not:</hi> 'tis lawful to rejoyce, even in the things of the world, <hi>Rejoyce in the wife of thy youth.</hi> God hath provided ſeveral delightful objects for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſenſe; there's Muſick for hearing, and there are ſmells, and ſweet ſmells for ſmelling, ſweet things for the taſte: God hath ſo ordered things, that every Senſe hath its delightful object; ſurely therefore it is lawful to take pleaſure, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the things of this world.</p>
               <p>But ſtill, though we do rejoyce in the things of this world, we muſt rejoyce as if we rejoyced not.</p>
               <p>For why ſhould I joy much in that which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enjoy? why now the things of this world I may uſe, but I cannot enjoy them, God only is to be enjoyed.</p>
               <p>Who will rejoyce with all his might in the blaze of a Wiſp? a Wiſp of Straw ſet on fire makes a great blaze, but it ends in black aſhes: who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces much in the blaze of the Wiſp? why truly the beſt outward thing, it is but the blaze of a Wiſp, and if we dont take heed, it ends in black aſhes.</p>
               <p>Who would rejoyce much in that which is but a <hi>Tanquam,</hi> a <hi>quaſi</hi> of good, which he cannot ſatisfie his ſoul in? there is a crack in the fineſt Chriſtal Glaſs in this world, a crevice: what outward thing is there in all the world, but hath ſome crevice in it? what beauty, but hath ſome Wart grows upon the face on't? Our Saviour Chriſt was at a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and when he was there the Wine was ſpent; why? for to ſhew that in the midſt of all our fulneſs and joy, there is a deficiency, and there is a want, bottles will be empty.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:45432:70"/>
               <p> And if it be the great work of a Chriſtian for to moderate his affections, then ſhold we not grieve as if we grieved not, and rejoyce as if we rejoyced not.</p>
               <p>The great work of a Chriſtian, what is it? why, the great work of a Chriſtian is not for to know much; the great work of a Chriſtian is not to have much; he is a Chriſtian indeed that grieves as if he grieved not, and rejoyces as if he rejoyced not, that moderates his affections, that hath the command and the true moderation of his affections, I, he is a Chriſtian indeed. So that thus then we ſee, that we are to uſe the world as if we us'd it not, in reference to this concernment, the <hi>matter</hi> of our joy.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As for the matter of our poſſeſſions, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>And let them that buy, be as though they poſſeſſed not:</hi> 'tis lawful, and very lawful to buy and ſell, and to poſſeſs.</p>
               <p>For elſe there would be no propriety, but there is a propriety in nature, the laſt Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet thy Neighbours Oxe, nor his Aſs, nor any thing that is his:</hi> nor any thing that is his: The Moral Law, the Law of Nature tells us, that there is an his, that is, a propriety; and the Goſpel tells us, and the Law of the Goſpel tells us, that there muſt be liberality, ſurely then its lawful to buy, and ſell, and to poſſeſs: 'tis lawful.</p>
               <p>But though we may buy, and ſell, and poſſeſs, yet we muſt poſſeſs as if we poſſeſſed not, buy as if we bought not, and poſſeſs as if we poſſeſſed not: For elſe,</p>
               <p>How can we be ſtrangers here: 'tis ſaid of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> by Faith, <hi>he was a ſtranger in the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe:</hi> A ſtranger in the Land of Promiſe, certainly if a man would let out his heart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pon any Land, a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:45432:70"/> good man would let out his heart to the utmoſt upon the Land of Promiſe. What, the Land of Promiſe, and yet a ſtranger to it: Yes, though it were the Land of Promiſe, yet a ſtranger to it.</p>
               <p>How can a man be patient in the loſs of things; If he be not weaned from them while he hath them. Surely <hi>Job</hi> was weaned from what he had, by being ſo patient under his loſs.</p>
               <p>And if that good men have other greater things and poſſeſſions for to mind, and they cannot intenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind both: why then a man muſt ſurely ſo poſſeſs, as if he poſſeſſed not. Why now a good man hath higher and greater poſſeſſions to mind, and inheritance Incorruptible, undefiled, that fadeth not away, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Heavens: And both he cannot mind toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but he muſt love the one and hate the other. The intention about the one, muſt be remiſneſs about the other. Then ſurely it is our duty to uſe the World as if we uſed it not, in reference unto this concernment; namely, this concernment of our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions. And ſo you ſee the thing now cleared by theſe four inſtances: We are to uſe the World as if we uſed it not; In the matter of our Relations; In the matter of our griefs; In the matter of our Joyes; And in the matter of our poſſeſſions.</p>
               <p>Well, but then fourthly. In the fourth place: What is there in theſe Reaſons of the Apoſtle, The ſhortneſs of the time, And the Faſhion of the world paſſing away. What is there in theſe Reaſons that may inforce this Exhortation, To uſe the World as if we uſed it not.</p>
               <p>Much every way (ſtill I muſt but touch at things).</p>
               <p>The time is ſhort. Uſe the World as if we uſed it not: For the time is ſhort.</p>
               <p>The time of our life is ſhort, 'tis but ſhort. A
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:45432:71"/> great buſineſs we have to do in reference to our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and our time to do it in is but ſhort. Time roul'd, and truſt up as it were into a little bundle; and therefore why ſhould we not uſe the World as if we uſed it not? If a Countrey man comes to <hi>London</hi> upon ſome buſineſs that doth concern him nearly in his life, why will he run up and down the City for to ſee things? Go and ſee the Lyons, and the Bears, and not mind and diſpatch his buſineſs. Or if a Citizen go into the Country about ſome bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs that concerns his life, will he run up and down the Cloſes for to catch Butter-flyes, and to gather Cowſlips, when all his time is but little enough for to do his buſineſs in? Surely no, we are upon our life, and we are upon our Eternity, and upon this little ſpot and moment of time hangs our Eternity: what ſhall we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>un up and down catching Butterflyes, gathering Cowſlips, running up and down to ſee the Lyons, and the Bears, and our buſineſs undone, and our time but little? All the time that we have is little enough to make our Calling and Election ſure.</p>
               <p>All the time we have is little enough for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for our great change. The Devil doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his time upon this ſcore. We read in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> that the Devil is come down with great wrath, for his time is ſhort. Shall the Devil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his time becauſe it is but ſhort, in a way of miſchief: And ſhall not we improve our time ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is but ſhort? Our time is ſhort, therefore let us uſe the World as though we uſed it not.</p>
               <p>But then ſecondly, as for the ſecond Reaſon, Uſe the World as if we uſed it not, we muſt, <hi>For the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of this world paſſeth away.</hi> The faſhion of this World, 'tis but a Scheme, it is but a piece of Page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antry, it is but a Stage, one goes off and another
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:45432:71"/> comes on. Take the World in the braveſt dreſs, and it is but a Faſhion: And as thats a Faſhion to day which was not yeſterday, thats a Faſhion to day which is none to morrow; Faſhions paſs away: So the Faſhion of the World paſſeth away. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was in favour greatly with his Father, and that favour paſt away. His Brethren ſold him; then he was in an afflicted condition, being ſold down to <hi>Egypt:</hi> That faſhion paſt away, he came into <hi>Potiphars</hi> houſe, and there he had favour. Well, there he had favour a little time, and that faſhion paſt away; then thrown into the Priſon, and there he was in a ſad condition again: and that Faſhion paſt away, he had favor with the Jaylor: And then he came to the Throne, to be the great Councellor of the Nation; and that laſted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot long, but that paſt away. What piece of the world is there, but the faſhion thereof paſſeth away.</p>
               <p>Will you inſtance in the ſtrongeſt natural piece of the World, or the civil moral piece of the World, or the ſinful faſhion of the World, or the Religious faſhion of the World, or the comfortable faſhion of the World?</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the natural piece, the Faſhion of the World: what ſtronger piece of the World than the Heavens and Earth. Now Read what is ſaid in the firſt of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> v. 10, 11. <hi>Thou Lord in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning haſt laid the Foundation of the Earth, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are the works of thine hands. They ſhall periſh, but thou remaineſt, and they all ſhall wax old as doth a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as a veſture ſhalt thou fold them up, and they ſhall be changed, but thou art the ſame,</hi> as the Heb. in the <hi>Pſalmes, But thou art he.</hi> But thou art the ſame, and thy years ſhall not fail; but as for them, though theſe things be bruſht over a little, as a veſture ſhalt thou fold them up, and they ſhall be changed. The
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:45432:72"/> nap of all theſe things, the faſhion of all theſe things, it will paſs away.</p>
               <p>Or will you inſtance in the civil moral part of the world, that faſhion thereof? What more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable thing is there in all the world than friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, a true friend to an ingenuous heart, there is nothing in this world more deſirable than friendſhip?

               <p>Will you inſtance in the ſinful faſhions of the world? why, it may be, the poor people of God they are in a mourning habit, in a mournful faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the enemies of the people of God, they are in a very brave and a gallant faſhion: you ſhall ſee how this faſhion paſſes away, in Iſa. 51. 7. <hi>Hearken unto me ye that know righteouſneſs, the people in whoſe heart is my Law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings, for the Moth ſhall eat them like a garment:</hi> They are brave fellows, and they are in a very brave and a gallant faſhion, but <hi>the moth ſhall eat them up like a garment, and the worm ſhall eat them like wooll, but my righteouſneſs ſhall be for ever. and my ſalvation from generation to generation.</hi> As for the redeemed of the Lord, at v. 11. <hi>But the redeemed of the Lord ſhall return, and come with ſinging unto</hi> Sion, <hi>and everlaſting joy ſhall be upon their head: They ſhall obtain gladneſs and joy, and ſorrow and</hi>

               <p>Or will you inſtance in the Religion piece and part of the world, and the faſhion thereof? You know what is ſaid in Heb. 12. v. 26. <hi>Once more I ſhake not the earth only, but alſo heaven;</hi> ſpeaking of the Jewiſh Worſhip, the Religious part, <hi>and this word, yet once more, ſignifies the removing of thoſe things that are ſhaken, as of things that are made, that thoſe things that cannot be ſhaken may remain.

Pray now, when a Traveller comes to his

                  </gap>s fine ſilver ſtream that glides by my door, it paſſeth away, why ſhould I ſet my heart upon it? Thus it is with all the things here below; the things of this world they paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the ſtrongeſt natural piece of the world, and the civil piece of the world, and the ſinful piece of the world, and the Religious piece of the world, and the comfortable piece of the world, all paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; why then ſhould we not uſe the world as if we us'd it not? And thus you may ſee what there is in theſe reaſons of the Apoſtle to it force this ſame, and that's the fourth thing.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, But when may a man be ſaid then, ſo to uſe the world as if he us'd it not?</p>
               <p>Why look, when a man doth ſo uſe the world; and the things thereof, as he doth walk with God in the uſe thereof, then he uſes the world as if he us'd it not; when one man walks with another, he turns as he turns: So when a man walks with God in the world, he turns as God turns: When God calls to joy, he joys; when God calls to grief, he grieves; he walks with God, for he turns as God turns: I ſay, look when a man doth ſo uſe the world, as he doth walk with God in the uſe of the world, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as God turns, then he doth uſe the world as if he us'd it not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Look when a man doth uſe the world, and the things thereof, in ſubordination to the things of God, then he doth uſe the world as if he us'd it not, in ſubordination to the things of God.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:45432:73"/>
               <p> And thirdly, Look when a man doth make it his buſineſs for to ſerve the Lord, and doth the things of the world by his by, then he doth uſe the world as if he us'd it not: As if a man doth make it his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to get the world, and prays by the by, and reads the Scriptures by the by, and doth good by the by: Now when a man doth make it his buſineſs to get the World, and uſes the things of God by the by, then he doth uſe the things of God as if he us'd them not. So on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Look when a man is dead, and eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from all the world, and the things thereof, through the communion and fellowſhip that he hath with Chriſt, then he doth uſe the World as if he us'd it not; for we die to the World, by living in God; I ſay, we die to the world, by living in God: Why now conſider it, it is one thing for a man to be dead unto the world, and another thing to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from this or that particular comfort of the World, this or that particular way of the World: Poſſibly I may abſtain from this or that particular way, or courſe of the World, becauſe my inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dont like out; ſome mens inclinations dont like of drunkenneſs, ſome mens inclinations dont like this way, or that way; poſſibly a man may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from this or that particular thing of the world, and yet not be dead to the whole world; poſſibly a man may be very negligent of the world, and ſlub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber over the things of the World, and yet not be dead to the World: A prodigal man is not dead to the World; its one thing for a man to be negligent of the World, and ſlubber over the things of the World, and another thing to be dead to the world, ſaith <hi>Calvin;</hi> this Phyloſophy is in every mans mouth, He is dead to the World, but few there are
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:45432:74"/> that are dead to the World, and eſtranged from the World, through their communion and fellowſhip with God: But I ſay, look when a man is dead, and eſtranged from the world, through communion and fellowſhip with God, then he uſes the World as if he us'd it not.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Look when a man can leave and forſake his worldly intereſt, his own intereſt in the world, that he may pleaſe others, and be at peace with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, truly it argues, that a man doth uſe the World as if he us'd it not: Thus it was with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Abraham</hi> gave <hi>Lot</hi> the choice; <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Elder, and the choice did belong to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but he gave <hi>Lot</hi> the choice, and he parted with his own intereſt for peace and quietneſs: Why <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> lived by Faith, and he us'd the World as if he us'd it not: Thus ſhould we do, for ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in Rom. 15. <hi>We then that are ſtrong, ought to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> the infirmities of the weak, and not to pleaſe our ſelves: Let every one of us pleaſe his Neighbour for his good to edification, for even Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf.</hi> See how the Apoſtle preſſes it; what more ordinary than this? every man ſeeks for to pleaſe himſelf, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the matters of the World: every man ſeeks for to pleaſe himſelf, Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf; would you therefore know when a man doth ſo uſe the World as if he us'd it not, if that you do ſo uſe the World, as you do walk with God in the midſt of it: The things of the World in ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the things of God, make it your buſineſs to ſerve the Lord, and other things by the by; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranged from the World, through communion and fellowſhip with God: You can part with your own intereſt for to pleaſe others, that are weak ones; this doth argue then, that you do uſe the World as if you us'd it not.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:45432:74"/>
               <p> Sixthly, Why, but ſuppoſe I do or do not, what's the conſequence? Suppoſe I do not uſe the World as if I us'd it not, What then?</p>
               <p>I will tell you what then.</p>
               <p>Then you do want this Character of a good man.</p>
               <p>Then you are not dead to the World, and if not dead to the World, then not dead with Chriſt; and if not communion with Chriſt in his Death, not communion with him in his Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Then you are defiled by the World, and the things thereof; uſe the world as if you us'd it not, and you are not defiled thereby; but if otherwiſe, you are defiled, by all the things that you meddle with, you are but defiled.</p>
               <p>And then your hearts will reproach you when you come to die; O when you come to die, and you lie upon your Death-bed; I had the World, and the things of the World, but I did not uſe the World as if I us'd it not: As the Mother ſaid, Where's the Child in the Cradle, when the houſe was on fire, and they had been getting out the goods, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling things out of the Fire: But at laſt, Where's the Child in the Cradle? So at laſt, when we come to die, O where's my Soul all this while? Your heart will reproach you when you come to die; and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is that man or woman whoſe heart ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him when he comes to die.</p>
               <p>Yea, let me ſay this farther, you cannot more prejudice the thing you love, nor wrong your ſelves more, than by loving it too much, and not uſing of it as if you us'd it not: A man leans upon a ſtick, and if it be too weak it breaks, he breaks the ſtick, and it runs into his hand; the <hi>ſtick</hi> ſuffers, and his <hi>hand</hi> ſuffers: So when we come to lean upon a thing, and dont uſe it as if we us'd it not, it
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:45432:75"/> breaks, and it runs into our hands: Look into the 23 of <hi>Ezek.</hi> and you ſhall ſee there how the <hi>Jews</hi> lovers, and what they reſted on, run into their hands, v. 5. <hi>And</hi> Aholah <hi>played the Harlot when ſhe was mine, and ſhe doted on her Lovers, on the</hi> Aſſyrians <hi>her Neighbours,</hi> v. 7. <hi>Thus ſhe committed her whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes with them, with all them that were the choſen men of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>and with all on whom ſhe doted, with all their Idols ſhe defiled her ſelf:</hi> What becomes of her?

Why ſhe doted upon the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> her lovers, and I have given her into the hand of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> her lovers, upon whom ſhe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Why, when a people ſhall dote upon this and that, God will give them into the hand of their lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and make them to run into their hands: 'tis a moſt prejudicial thing to dote upon any thing in this World.</p>
               <p>And indeed, (to ſay no more in it but this) how will you be able to ſuffer? Suffering times are <hi>come</hi> Chriſtians; not <hi>coming,</hi> but <hi>come:</hi> How will you be able to ſuffer in theſe ſuffering times, if you dont uſe the World as if you us'd it not? What makes the difficulty in ſuffering, but becauſe we cannot part with this or that Relation, or this or that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort? Oh this makes the difficulty in our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; do but uſe the World now as if you us'd it not, you will be the more able to ſuffer; but if you dont uſe the world as if you us'd it not, how will you be able to ſuffer in this ſuffering day? Wherefore as you do deſire that you may be able to ſuffer in this ſuffering day: As you do deſire that you may not be whipt by your own lovers: that you may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot be given into the hand of your own lovers:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:45432:75"/> that that which you reſt upon ſhould not run into your hand: As you do deſire that your own hearts may not reproach you when you come to dye: As you do deſire that you may not be defiled by the things of the world: As you do deſire that you may have communion with Chriſt in his death, and in his Reſurrection: And as you do deſire that you may have this mark and character of a good man, labour ſo to uſe this world as if you uſed it not.</p>
               <p>But Seventhly you will ſay, What ſhall we do that we may get our hearts into this gratious and holy frame, which indeed will fit us for every condition, under grace? what ſhall we do that we may uſe the world as if we us'd it not.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhall a little farther ſpeak to this, and ſhew you what that man doth that doth uſe the world as if he uſed it not. And ſecondly, give you ſome means.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all for that, what that man doth, that doth uſe the world as if he uſed it not?</p>
               <p n="1">1. He will be ſure to uſe Grace in the uſe of the world, and in all his dealings in the world, and the things thereof. He is never ſatisfied unleſs he doth ſee that he doth uſe Grace in the uſe of the world, and the things thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is alwayes ready to give up that part of the world unto God wherein his affections are moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, His <hi>Iſaac;</hi> for ſaith he, God doth uſe to try his people in the things wherein they do moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: And therefore ſtill he is upon that, ready to give up that unto God wherein his affections are the moſt engaged.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He will be ſure to ſtand at a diſtance from the World and the things thereof, in the getting, as well as in the keeping; and in the keeping as well as in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:45432:76"/> the getting. There are ſome that are very worldly in the getting part, and are very free and prodigal as to the keeping. Some are not ſo worldly in the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but they are worldly in the keeping. A man that doth uſe the world as if he uſed it not, he doth ſtand at a diſtance from the things of the world in the getting as well as in the keeping, and in the keeping as well as in the getting.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He doth not place his Religion in a morning and in an evening duty, but in his walking with God in his place. Every man hath ſo much grace as he uſes in his place. Conſider what I ſay, He doth not place his Religion (he that uſes the world as if he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it not) in a morning and in an evening Prayer, but in his walking with God. <hi>Adams</hi> tryal did not lye in the Morning and in the Evening Prayer; but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> tryal lay among the Trees. So the tryal of a man don't lye in the morning and in the evening du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but in the Trees, and in his Calling, and in his place. And he doth not place his Religion meerly in a morning Prayer, or in an evening Prayer, and all the day after muddling up and down in the earth. No, he that uſes the world as if he uſed it not, he doth not place his Religion in an Evening, or in a Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duty, but in walking with God in the uſe of the world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A man that uſes the world as if he uſed it not, he is ſometimes more afraid of proſperity than of adverſity. All men are afraid of adverſity, but a man that uſes the world as if he uſed it not, he is ſometimes more afraid of proſperity: I am ſure of this, he will fear God in proſperity, and love God in Adverſity. Now therefore, would you uſe the world as if you uſed it not, remember theſe five things.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:45432:76"/>
               <p> But ſecondly by way of Means. If you would uſe the world and the things thereof, as if you uſed it not; then labour to poſſeſs your hearts much with Gods Allſufficiency. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. <hi>If riches increaſe, ſet not your hearts upon them, once and twice have I heard it, that power belongs unto God.</hi> And mercy alſo unto the Lord: God's All-ſufficient, there's enough in God alone, Come O my Soul, poſſeſs your heart with this, Ah, there's enough in God alone. Still be preſſing this upon your own ſouls, There's enough in God alone, Gods All-ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Look upon the things of the World, with the proſpective of the Scripture; not with one of the worlds glaſſes: Not with the worlds Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying-glaſs. The world, and the glaſs of the world; If you look upon the world with the glaſs of the world, there you ſhall find that the things of the world are called Goods, and they are called Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, An Eſtate and Subſtance. But look upon the world with the Proſpective of the Scriptures, there they are called Shadows, there they are called Vanities, there they are called Things that are not. Whats the reaſon that people are ſo much in love with the things of the world, but becauſe they look upon them with the multiplying glaſs of the world, and not with the glaſs, and proſpective of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Never fall in love with any condition for it ſelf, but for the good of the condition. Love not your condition for the condition it ſelf, but for the God of your condition. I do but name things.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Take all Gods Allarums of death, and mingle thoſe with the conſideration of the death of Chriſt, Chriſt crucified. There is never a death that doth paſs before us, but its Gods Alarm, and it
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:45432:77"/> calls off from the world and the things thereof. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this I muſt ſay, It is not all the deaths in the world will make us dye to the world, only the death of Chriſt: take Chriſt Crucified, and then you will dye to the world. And therefore I ſay, take Gods Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ums of death, but be ſure that you mingle thoſe Alarums with the conſideration of the death of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And then fifthly, Afford the world, and the things thereof, ſo much of your love, as better things do leave: For Chriſtians, that which is too cold for God, is hot enough for the world; I ſay it again, <hi>That which is too cold for God, is hot enough for the world;</hi> and therefore afford the things of the world ſo much of your love, as better things do leave; for that which is too cold for God, is hot enough for the world, and the things thereof.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Let the name of the Lord be very preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in your hearts, and in your eyes; and then you will uſe the things of the world as if you us'd them not. <hi>Abraham</hi> had a very great regard unto the Name of God, and he would not have it ſaid, that the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> made him rich; not a ſhoe-lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet will he take from him; it ſhall never be ſaid, that the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> made <hi>Abraham</hi> rich: He had a very high eſteem of the Name of God; O God alone ſhall have the honour (ſaith <hi>Abraham)</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Abraham</hi> rich; it ſhall never be ſaid the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> made <hi>Abraham</hi> rich: He had a great care of the Name of God: So if men would carry the ſenſe of Gods Name with them into the World, and the things thereof, they would uſe the World as if they us'd it not: It ſhall never be ſaid that a baſe unworthy way made me rich; no, <hi>God</hi> ſhall have the honour of it, and <hi>Faith</hi> ſhall have the honour of it,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:45432:77"/> and Prayer ſhall have the honour on't.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Go to the Lord, and beg of the Lord to fulfil his promiſes: Now Gods promiſes are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many this way; but I ſhall only turn you unto that in the laſt of <hi>Zech.</hi> 20. a promiſe ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the latter times: <hi>In that day ſhall there be upon the bells of the horſes, holineſs unto the Lord.</hi> The bells of the horſes; upon the <hi>bells of the Temple?</hi> no, upon the <hi>bells of the horſes,</hi> your Carriers horſes: In that day ſhall there be holineſs upon the <hi>bells of the horſes, holineſs unto the Lord: And the pots in the Lords houſe ſhall be like the bowls before the Altar;</hi> yea, <hi>every pot in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and in</hi> Judah, <hi>ſhall be holineſs unto the Lord of Hoſts:</hi> Every pot in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> every pot in your <hi>houſe,</hi> ſhall be holineſs unto the Lord: go to God to fulfil this promiſe; O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>here is ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe lies for the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tter times, let's go to God to fulfil this promiſe, that holineſs may be written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all our pots, and then ſhall we uſe this world as if we us'd it not.</p>
               <p>Eighthly and laſtly, Conſider what a good thing it is to uſe this world as if we us'd it not.</p>
               <p>Thereby you ſhall be able for to want, and to part with the world with eaſe: <hi>I know how to want,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>I know how to abound.</hi> Truly give me but this grace, and I will ſpeak with <hi>Paul;</hi> give me but this grace, to uſe the world as if I us'd it not, and I will ſay with him, Now I know how to want, and how to abound: If you uſe your Relation as if you us'd it not, you will part with your Relation more eaſily; if you uſe your Land as if you us'd it not, you will part with it more eaſily: Chriſtians, parting times are coming, the Lord knows how ſoon we may be parted from the boſom of our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45432:78"/> Relations, and from all our enjoyments that we have here; would you part eaſily when the parting blow ſhall come? Now uſe the world as if you us'd it not: now uſe the world as if you us'd it not.</p>
               <p>Thereby alſo you ſhall have more of the world, have it in more abundance, by uſing the world as if you us'd it not, you ſhall be no loſer: I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtood and wondred at <hi>Abraham;</hi> for we ſay, that the rouling ſtone gathers no Moſs. <hi>Abraham</hi> went out of his own Country; God commands him in <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. to forſake his Kindred, and his Fathers houſe: So <hi>Abraham</hi> departed, v. 4. and <hi>Abraham</hi> came, and <hi>they went out to go into the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>and into the Land of</hi> Canaan <hi>they came,</hi> v. 5. And at v. 10. <hi>There was a famine in the Land, and</hi> Abraham <hi>went down into Egypt.</hi> A famine in the Land! why, but did not God call him thither? yes, <hi>Go unto a Land that I ſhall ſhew thee,</hi> v. 1. God ſhewed him thither, yet there he met with a famine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> So one may have a clear call from God, and yet meet with a great deal of afflictions in the way that God calls them to; he goes down to <hi>Egypt</hi> to ſojourn there: When he came into <hi>Egypt, the Lord plagued</hi> Pharaoh <hi>and his houſe with great plagues, becauſe of</hi> Sarah Abrahams <hi>Wife.</hi> At v. 18. <hi>And</hi> Pharoah <hi>called</hi> Abraham, <hi>and ſaid, what is this? now therefore behold thy Wife, take her, and go thy way: And they ſent him away, and his Wife, and all that he had,</hi> ver. 10. Well, away they go; <hi>And</hi> Abraham <hi>went out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, he, and his Wife, and all that he had, and</hi> Lot <hi>with him, into the South,</hi> v. 2. <hi>And</hi> Abraham <hi>was very rich in Cattel, in ſilver, and in gold:</hi> A ſtrange thing, to grow rich in <hi>Cattel:</hi> How could he drive his Cattel
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:45432:78"/> up and down from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and up and down the Country? Yes, thus removing at the Command of the Lord, living in Tents, and uſing the world as if he us'd it not; thereby, I ſay, you ſhall have the world, and have it in more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>Yea, thereby you ſhall have it in a better edition, in a better impreſſion, the world, and the things thereof, ſanctified unto you; uſe the world as if you us'd it not, and the things thereof, as if you us'd them not, you ſhall have them in a better edition ſanctified to you.</p>
               <p>Yea, thereby you ſhall have that which is better than all, you ſhall have the mind of Chriſt; <hi>And we hope we have the mind of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; we believe we have the mind of Chriſt: who have the mind of Chriſt? ſaith <hi>David,</hi> in Pſa. 119. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am a ſtranger in this earth, hide not thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments from me:</hi> Here's his argument, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. <hi>Whom ſhall he teach knowledge?</hi> v. 9. <hi>And whom ſhall he make to underſtand Doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breaſts,</hi> them ſhall he teach knowledge, and them ſhall he make to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand doctrine.</p>
               <p>I'le ſay no more but this, thereby you ſhall be happy indeed; uſe the world as if you us'd it not, and thereby you ſhall be happy: Who is the happy man in the world? <hi>He's an happy man that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn, and be contemned,</hi> ſaith the Heathen <hi>Seneca.</hi> He's the happy man in the world, that can uſe the world as if he us'd it not.</p>
               <p>And yet again ile repeat that, Thereby you ſhall be fit to ſuffer in ſuffering times. Suffering times are upon us, and by uſing the world as if we us'd it
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:45432:79"/> not, you ſhall be fit to ſuffer: And therefore again I ſay, As you do deſire that you may be fit to ſuffer in ſuffering times. That you may be happy. That you may have the mind of Chriſt. That you may have the things of the world in a better Edition. That you may have them in more abundance. That you may know how to want and part wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> all things eaſily. Now uſe the world as if you uſed it not.</p>
               <p>And if nothing elſe will do, I beſeech you take theſe two Arguments that the Apoſtle here uſes, and lay them with all their weight upon your Souls, lay them with your experience. Beloved, this I muſt ſay to you, The Holy Ghoſt doth never ſpend reaſons in vain, the Holy Ghoſt hath no waſt of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Scripture. Here are two Reaſons, <hi>The time is ſhort.</hi> Uſe the world as if you us'd it not, <hi>For the time is ſhort.</hi> Uſe the world, for the Faſhion of the world paſſeth away. 'Tis Scripture reaſon, and there is no waſte in it, and therefore lay it unto your own experience: And if you deſire now to get this holy frame of Spirit, and to uſe the world as if you us'd it not: go and ſay unto your own Souls, Come O my Soul, why ſhould I not uſe the world as if I us'd it not? indeed the time is ſhort, Ah the time of our opportunity is ſhort; The time of our Spiritual enjoyment is ſhort; The time of this life is ſhort. The time is ſhort O my Soul, and therefore why ſhould I not uſe the world as if I us'd it not!</p>
               <p>And come O my Soul, the Faſhion of this world paſſeth away: And this I have experience of, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all the Revolutions of theſe later times, how the Faſhion of all things hath paſt away: We have
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:45432:79"/> ſeen in theſe late Revolutions the Faſhion of this world paſſeth away, and therefore come O my Soul, why ſhould you not uſe the world as if you us'd it not: You have now <hi>Riches,</hi> it paſſeth away! <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> paſs away: And Friends paſs away; And <hi>Creature-Comforts,</hi> they paſs away: The Faſhion of this world it paſſeth away, and therefore O my ſoul, now uſe the world as if you us'd it not. Thus the Apoſtle ſpeaks, this is his Argument, and theſe are his Arguments; And ſo ſay I, Brethren and Beloved, The time is ſhort, It remaineth therefore, that both they that have Wives, be as though they had none; And they that weep, as though they wept not; And they that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not; And they that buy as though they poſſeſſed not; And they that uſe this world as not abuſing it; For the Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this world paſſeth away.</p>

                  <q>Surely the Wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee, the remainder of wrath ſhalt thou reſtrain.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN this Pſalm we have a Declaration of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and glorious appearance of God, in and for his Church and people. <hi>In Judah is God known, his Name is great in Iſrael, in Salem alſo is his Tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Sion,</hi> ver. 1, 2. Where God appears as a Captain and General unto his people, and as a Judg.</p>
               <p>As a Captain and General; therefore in ver. 3. <hi>There</hi> (In <hi>Syon) brake he the Arrows of the Bow, the Shield, and the Sword, and the Battel. Thou art more glorious and excellent then the Mountains of prey. At thy rebuke O God of Jacob, both the Chariot and Horſe are caſt into a dead ſleep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As a <hi>Judg,</hi> at ver. 8. <hi>Thou didſt cauſe Judgment to be heard from Heaven, the Earth feared and was ſtill: When God aroſe to Judgment, to ſave all the meek of the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:45432:80"/>
               <p> But if God do thus appear, to, and for, and with his people, why doth he ſuffer the wrath and anger of men to be ſo much againſt his people?</p>
               <p>Why he anſwers it in ver. 10. <hi>Surely the wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee, the remainder of wrath thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain.</hi> Though God do ſuffer the Enemies of his people to be very angry and wrathful with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet that wrath of theirs ſhall turn unto the praiſe of God, and the remainder of their wrath God will reſtrain. From whence then I take up this Obſervation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Though there be a great deal of anger or wrath in the hearts of men againſt the people of God: Yet God will either turn their wrath unto his own praiſe, or reſtrain their wrath.</p>
               <p>For the clearing and proſecuting whereof, two things will fall under our conſideration.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there is a great deal of wrath and anger in the hearts of men againſt the people of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That this wrath God will either turn to his praiſe, or reſtrain the ſame.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, There is a great deal of wrath and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the hearts of men againſt the people of God. A great deal of anger; ſo much anger as doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to wrath, for wrath is the height of anger: Now the men of the world, they are wrath with the people of God, not only angry, but <hi>wrathfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed,</hi> Pſal. 124. <hi>Had not the Lord bin on our ſide when men roſe up againſt us, then they had ſwallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled againſt us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is not only <hi>Wrath</hi> in their hearts againſt the people of God, but ſuch wrath as doth amount to Rage. For as wrath is the height of Anger, ſo Rage is the height of Wrath. Now there is Rage
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:45432:81"/> alſo in the hearts of men againſt the people of God. <hi>Why do the Heathen Rage?</hi> Pſal. 2. They Rage.</p>
               <p>And there is not only Rage in the hearts of the wicked againſt the people of God; but ſuch Rage as doth amount to Fury. For as Rage is the height of Wrath, ſo Fury is the height of Rage. Now there is Fury in the hearts of men againſt the people of God. In <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 13. Then <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in his <hi>Rage and Fury</hi> commanded to bring <hi>Shadrach, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhach</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> and they brought theſe men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, v. 19. Then was <hi>Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, there is not only a Fury in the hearts of men againſt the people of God, but there is a Hatred in their hearts againſt the Saints and people of God. For as Fury is the height of Rage, ſo Rage ſetled, is Hatred. Hatred is the worſt of all, 'tis ſetled an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Wrath, and Rage, and Fury. Now wicked men they do hate the Saints. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. 21. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſhall ſlay the wicked, and they that hate the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall be deſolate. Yea, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 25. <hi>Conſider mine Enemies, for they are many, and they hate me with cruel hatred,</hi> v. 19. So that thus then we ſee in the general, that there is a great deal of Anger and wrath in the hearts of men againſt the people of God.</p>
               <p>Well, but for the opening of this a little further: 'Twill be ſaid, what kind of Anger and Hatred is there in the hearts of men againſt the people of God?</p>
               <p>And how comes it to paſs that they ſhould ſo hate and be ſo wrathfully diſpleaſed with the Saints and people of God, that do them no hurt?</p>
               <p>To give you ſome account of this: Firſt of all, If you ask what kind of Anger and Hatred, or Wrath
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:45432:81"/> there is in the hearts of men againſt the people of God.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, 1. It is a violent wrath and anger: <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>violent</hi> men are riſen up againſt me.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it is a <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>violent</hi> wrath or anger, ſo it is a <hi>fraudulent</hi> and <hi>deceitful</hi> wrath: Bloudy and <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> men ſhall not live out half their dayes; ſpeaking of the Enemies of the People of God. Their wrath is not only violent, but there is a fraudulency that is joyned therewithal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As it is a deceitful and a fraudulent wrath and anger: So it is a <hi>Mortal</hi> wrath and Anger that is in their hearts towards the people of God. A <hi>devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, conſuming,</hi> and <hi>deſtroying</hi> wrath. <hi>They eat up my people as they eat bread,</hi> Pſal. 14. If the Lord had not bin with us, they had <hi>ſwallowed us up quick,</hi> Pſal. 124. And they ſhall <hi>kill</hi> you, ſaith our Saviour Chriſt. So that this wrath and anger that is in the hearts of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, It is a mortal, deadly, deſtroying, conſume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and devouring wrath.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As it is a mortal, deadly, deſtroying and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming wrath: So it is a <hi>Blaſpheming</hi> wrath. How long ſhall fooliſh men <hi>Blaſpheme</hi> thy Name? <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhekah</hi> was angry, and he did not only Blaſpheme the people of God, but God himſelf. <hi>Where is now your God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. As their wrath is a <hi>Blaſpheming</hi> wrath, ſo it is an <hi>unreaſonable</hi> wrath. Why do the Heathen rage? <hi>Why?</hi> Why they have no reaſon for it. <hi>Why</hi> do the Heathen rage, and the People imagine a <hi>vain thing?</hi> 'Tis a <hi>vain</hi> thing, they have no <hi>reaſon</hi> for it. The wrath that wicked men have againſt the people of God, and their Anger, it is moſt unreaſonable.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As it is an unreaſonable wrath and anger; ſo it is an inſulting wrath and anger, whereby they do
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:45432:82"/> inſult over the poor people of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. <hi>By the Rivers of Babylon we ſate down, yea, we wept when we remembred Sion. We hanged our Harps upon the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, For there they that carryed us away Captive, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us a Song: And they that waſted us, required of us mirth, ſaying, Sing us one of the Songs of</hi> Sion; inſulting over them. And ſo in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. They will make merry, and ſend gifts one to another, rejoycing over the dead Witneſſes. 'Tis an inſulting wrath and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that they are filled withal.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And then further, As it is an <hi>Inſulting</hi> wrath and anger; ſo the wrath and anger that is in the hearts of wicked men towards the Saints, it is an univerſal wrath and anger. For though they be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with one perſon, their anger doth not ſtay there, but it riſeth unto all the party of the Saints. <hi>Hamans</hi> wrath began with <hi>Mordecai,</hi> in <hi>Heſt.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>And when</hi> Haman <hi>ſaw that</hi> Mordecai <hi>bowed not, nor did him reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, then was</hi> Haman <hi>full of wrath.</hi> What then: <hi>And he thought ſcorn to lay hands on</hi> Mordecai <hi>alone, For they had ſhewed him the people of</hi> Mordecai: <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> Haman <hi>ſought to deſtroy all the Jews.</hi> So wicked men, they begin (it may be) to be angry with one Saint; but from that one, their wrath and anger doth ariſe to them all. 'Tis an univerſal wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Seed of the Godly: They take occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from one, and fall upon all.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And then laſtly, As it is an univerſal wrath and anger, ſo it is an implacable, an <hi>unappeaſeable, never-dying,</hi> and <hi>everlaſting</hi> wrath, <hi>Amos</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, For three tranſgreſſions of</hi> Edom, <hi>and for four, I will not turn away the puniſhment thereof; becauſe he did purſue his Brother with the Sword, and did caſt off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and kept his wrath for ever.</hi> It is an everlaſting wrath, wicked men will not be appeaſed.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:45432:82"/>
               <p> This is a certain Rule, The more there is of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious end that any evil work hath, the more laſting, holding, and continuing is that evil work. Now in <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 2. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>They ſhall put you out of the Synagogue; yea, the time cometh, that whoſoever kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you, will think that he doth God Service.</hi> The Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack reads it ſo, That whoſoever killeth you, will think that he doth bring a Sacrifice unto God. In <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 20. ſaith the Lord by <hi>Moſes,</hi> unto <hi>Pharaoh, Let my people go that they may ſerve me.</hi> Now this is the errand that <hi>Moſes</hi> hath: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> anſwers it thus, ver. 25. <hi>And Pharaoh called for</hi> Moſes, <hi>and for</hi> Aaron, <hi>and ſaid, go ye, Sacrifice to your God in the Land.</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſaith in the Name of the Lord, <hi>Let my people go that they may ſerve me: Pharaoh</hi> underſtands it concerning <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and therefore ſaith he, go and offer <hi>Sacrifice</hi> unto your God. And indeed the thing <hi>Sacrifice</hi> hath the ſame word. The word that is uſed here in this 16th of John, <hi>Whoſoever killeth you, will think that he doth</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Now in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. the Sacrifice that Chriſt offered, hath the ſame word, Walk in love, as Chriſt hath alſo loved us, and hath given himſelf <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, An Offering and a Sacrifice. So that as good Authors do obſerve, What Chriſt ſaith here, <hi>They ſhall think that they do God good Service:</hi> 'tis as much as if he ſhould ſay, They ſhall think when they kill you, they ſhall offer a great Sacrifice unto God. But this is the thing I bring it for, The more Religious end any evil action hath, the more holding and continuing is that evil action. Now wicked men for their malice, they ſhall have a Religious end; they ſhall think they do God good ſervice: their malice therefore, and their wrath againſt the people of God, is never dying, and an everlaſting wrath. Thus you ſee what kind of wrath it is.</p>

               <p>But then ſecondly, How comes it to paſs that there ſhould be ſuch a deal of anger and wrath in the hearts of men againſt the people of God; for the people of God are a quiet and a peaceable people.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, ſo they are: But who more quiet, and peaceable, and meek, than our Lord and Saviour Chriſt; he lift not up his voice in the ſtreets, and yet who ever bare more anger and wrath from men than He.</p>
               <p>Yea, the Saints are not only quiet, meek and peaceable, but beneficial to the men where they live. <hi>The innocent delivers the Land:</hi> Yet notwithſtanding, ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. <hi>I have ſeen a ſore evil under the Sun, there was a little City, and few men within it: And there came a great King againſt it, and beſieged it and built great Bulwarks againſt it: Now there was found in it a poor wiſe man, and he by his wiſdome delivered the City, yet no man remembred that ſame poor man. Then ſaid I, Wiſdom is better than ſtrength, nevertheleſs the poor mans Wiſdom is deſpiſed, and his words are not heard.</hi> So though the Saints and people of God do deliver a Nation, and are exceeding beneficial to the people where they live, and where they are, yet they ſhall be deſpiſed, yet there ſhall be wrath and malice in the hearts of men againſt the Saints of God.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, how doth this come to paſs, that there ſhould be ſuch a deal of wrath and malice in the hearts of men againſt the people of God?</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, the Saints and people of God, and the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:45432:84"/> men of the world, they are directly contrary one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another: they are contrary in their Birth, and in their Original. For the men of the world, they are of their Father the Devil, who was a Murderer: But the Saints and people of God, God is their Father.</p>
               <p>They are not only contrary in their original, but they are contrary in their principles. For the one are the Seed of the Woman, and the other the Seed of the Serpent, whoſe Principles are contrary. The Seed of the Bond-woman at the beſt, and the Seed of the Free-Woman.</p>
               <p>Yea, they are not only contrary in their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but they are contrary in their Worſhip: For the Worſhip of the World is a pompous and a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Worſhip, but the Worſhip of the Saints is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, <hi>Such worſhippers doth the Father ſeek, that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in Spirit and truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as their Worſhip is contrary one unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo their deeds and their practices are contrary. For <hi>why</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>did</hi> Cain <hi>kill his Brother Abel, but becauſe his deeds were evil, and his Brothers good?</hi> Now one contrary ſeeks to deſtroy another. Why theſe are contrary; They are contrary one to another, contrary in their Original; Contrary in their Principles; Contrary in their Worſhip; Contrary in their lives and Practices: And therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that there is ſuch a deal of wrath and anger in the hearts of the men of the World againſt the Saints and people of God.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, The Saints and people of God, they do not regard the men of the World, and the men of the World they think ſo. Now for high and lofty men to be ſlighted, and not regarded, this makes them angry. In <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. when the three children would not bow down unto the Image, <hi>There are certain Jews</hi>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:45432:85"/> (ſay they to the King) <hi>that thou haſt ſet over the Affairs of</hi> Babylon, Shadrach, Meſhach, <hi>and</hi> Abednego; <hi>Theſe men O King have not regarded thee.</hi> Why they think now, that if the people of God don't bow down to their Commandments, and to their Idols, that they don't regard the Magiſtrate, <hi>Theſe men have not regarded thee:</hi> And the truth is, Godly men that are the Saints and people of God, they cannot regard them, <hi>For bleſsed is the man</hi> (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt) <hi>that regardeth not the proud, nor ſuch as turn aſide to lyes.</hi> God hath given a bleſſing to thoſe that regard not the proud. Now wicked men cannot bear this, that they ſhould not be regarded; high and great men of the world, that they ſhould not be regarded: and therefore no wonder that there is ſuch a deal of wrath and anger in their hearts againſt the people of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Saints and people of God, they do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the men of the world, and do ſeparate from them; <hi>Come out from among them, and be ye ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, touch no unclean thing.</hi> Now when we with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from men, and from their Worſhip: We do condemn their Worſhip; and the men of the world don't love to be condemned. Noah <hi>condemned the world;</hi> And by the ſeparation of the Saints from them, they do condemn them, and they don't love (I ſay) to be condemned. To ſeparate from them, and from their Worſhip, this they cannot bear. The Saints do ſeparate from them, and therefore there is ſuch a deal of anger and wrath in their hearts againſt them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As the Saints and people of God do ſeparate and withdraw from them, upon which they are much provoked: So the Saints and people of God do hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in their proceedings. A man doth not
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:45432:85"/> love to be hindered in his proceedings: the Saints and people of God, they do hold wicked mens hands that they cannot proceed, hold their hands by their Prayers. I remember a ſtory of Mr. <hi>Tyndal,</hi> that bleſſed firſt Tranſlater of the Bible into Engliſh, that dyed a Martyr in <hi>Flanders,</hi> being then at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and much reſpected by the Merchants there. There was a great report of a certain juggler that could bring a diſh of meat from any Princes Table, and ſo ſet the Table that they were at with ſeveral Diſhes, from ſeveral Princes Tables: Pray, ſaith <hi>Tyndal</hi> to the Merchants, will you let me be at your Supper; Yes, and ſo they carried him: And when he was there, the Juggler tryed his skill, and ſweat, and took a great deal of pains; but ſaith he, I cannot do it, there is ſome man here that doth hold my hands. And <hi>Tyndal</hi> only ſet himſelf to this, to believe that he ſhould not do it. I ſpeak it only to this, that the people of God, they hold their hands. And in this 76. <hi>Pſalm, The men of might, they find <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>t their hands. There brake he the Arrows of the Bow, the Shield, and the Sword, and the Battel: The ſtout-hearted are ſpoiled, They have ſlept their ſleep, and none of the men of might have found their hands.</hi> Why? Why there brake he the Bow and the Arrow. There. Where? In <hi>Salem.</hi> In the Aſſembly of the Saints, by their Prayers. Now men cannot endure to be hindred in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. The Saints do it, and therefore there is ſuch a great deal of anger and wrath in the hearts of them againſt the people of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But then further, As the Saints and people of God do hinder them in their proceedings, which doth anger them; So they do deſtroy their Gods, deſtroy their Idols. Men of all things cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to have their Gods deſtroyed; how angry were
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:45432:86"/> they when <hi>Paul</hi> came and Preacht down the Gods of <hi>Diana?</hi> then they were in a Rage, <hi>Oh great is</hi> Diana, <hi>Paul</hi> Preaches down our Gods, and deſtroyes our Gods. The people of God do deſtroy the Gods of the wicked, no wonder therefore that they are ſo provok't againſt the Saints and people of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As the people of God do deſtroy their Gods, and their Worſhip, ſo they do deſtroy their ſins and luſts. The Saints are enemies unto all their luſts. Wicked men cannot endure to be kept from their luſts: but if they be hindred from their luſts, kept in and reſtrained from their luſts, what ſay they then? In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Let us break their bands aſunder, and caſt away their Cords from us.</hi> Theſe Puritans, they will not let us play upon the Sabbath day, they will not let us have leave to dance about a May-pole, they put Cords upon us, and bring us into bonds, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our liberty. <hi>Why do the Heathen rage, &amp;c. The Kings of the Earth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take counſel together againſt the Lord, and againſt his Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Why, wherein is it expreſt? Why they ſay, <hi>Let us break their bands aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us.</hi> The people of God are great enemies to their wickedneſs, and therefore they are ſo angry; full and furious againſt the people of God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As the people of God are enemies unto all their luſts, ſo the men of the World they are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies unto the Saints, unto all their waies, and duties, and graces. The Saints are a praying people: The men of the World are Enemies to Prayer: Forms of Prayer they can endure, but the power of Prayer they cannot bear.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Saints and people of God are righteous in their Generation: The men of the World cannot endure the truth of the Generation, the Grace of the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:45432:86"/> Generation, the righteouſneſs of the Generation, they cannot endure it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Saints and people of God, they have, and they are ſtampt with the Image of God: the Image of Chriſt is ſtampt upon them; and the more that any man is ſtampt with the Image of God, the more the men of the world hate him. Why there are the footſteps of God in the Creatures; man at the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was made after the Image of God, now being raiſed again by Chriſt, the very image of God is ſtampt upon the Saints, and wicked men cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to ſee the Image of God; the more they ſee the Image of God ſhining forth in any man, the more angry they are. But now the Saints, they have the Image of God ſtampt upon them, and therefore no wonder that they are thus angry. And thus you ſee what kind of wrath it is that is in the hearts of the men of the world againſt the people of God: and how it comes to paſs that there is ſuch a deal of wrath in the hearts of wicked men againſt the people of God.</p>
               <p>But then ſecondly, Will God let wicked men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in this their wrath and anger againſt the people of God.</p>
               <p>No, but ſaith the ſecond part of the Doctrine, the Lord he will either turn their wrath and anger unto his own praiſe, or he will reſtrain it. You have both he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e in the Text; thou wilt turn their anger unto thy praiſe O Lord, and the remnant of their wrath, thou wilt reſtrain. Either God will turn their wrath unto his own praiſe, or he will reſtrain it. I uſe to expreſs it thus, by the Miller that lets the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter run: So much water as will ſerve his turn to grind the Corn, he lets it run, the reſt he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain, and don't let it run. So the Lord doth let
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:45432:87"/> the wrath of man run ſo much as may grind his corn, ſo much as may ſerve his turn, ſo much as may work to his praiſe: The remnant he doth reſtrain, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will work the wrath and anger of men to his own praiſe, or he will reſtrain the ſame.</p>

                  </gap>s he will reſtrain it: In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. <hi>v.</hi> 8. ſpeaking of the afflictions of the people of God: <hi>In meaſure when it ſhooteth forth wilt thou debate with it; he ſtayeth his rough wind, in the day of the Eaſt-wind:</hi> Conſider that expreſſion, <hi>He ſtayeth his rough wind, in the day of the Eaſt-wind.</hi> The <hi>Eaſt-wind</hi> is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious wind, a hurtful wind, a piercing wind, and a waſting wind. Why now this Eaſt-wind may blow but mildly, and it may blow roughly: Why, ſaith the Lord, when wicked men that are rough, and when they are very rough, God will ſtay his rough wind in the day of his Eaſt-wind: Though it be a day of Gods Eaſt-wind, and wicked men are very rough, God will ſtay his rough wind: The wrath and anger of wicked men is his rough wind, but God will ſtay his rough wind in the day of his Eaſt-wind: Some times he will reſtrain it.</p>
               <p>Some times again he will turn their wrath and anger unto his own praiſe; and for that, I'le only turn to the third of <hi>Dan.</hi> you ſee how angry the King was when the three children would not bow down unto his Image, <hi>v.</hi> 13. Then <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in his <hi>rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach,</hi> &amp;c. at the 19th ver. Then was <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> full of fury, and the form of his viſage was changed againſt <hi>Shadrach,</hi> &amp;c. and he commanded the moſt mighty men that were in his Army, to bind <hi>Shadrach, &amp;c.</hi> and to caſt them into the burning fiery Furnace: what was the iſſue? God let this wrath go on; but in the end, ſee how it turned to Gods praiſe; when
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:45432:87"/> 
                  <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſaw what he had done, <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I make a Decree, that every People, Nation and Language, which ſpeak anything amiſs againſt the God of</hi> Shadrach, Meſhach, <hi>and</hi> Abednego, <hi>ſhall be cut in pieces, and their houſes ſhall be made a dunghill, but there is no other God that can deliver after this ſort.</hi> Thus the rage and wrath of the King turned to the praiſe of God.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay then, how will the Lord turn the wrath of men unto his praiſe? 'tis a day of much wrath, and of great anger in the hearts of men: Wicked men are full of wrath and anger at this day againſt the people of God; 'tis good news, that God will either reſtrain it, or turn it to his praiſe: But how will God turn the rage and wrath of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men unto the praiſe of God? and what aſſurance may we have of this? and what is our duty that flows from hence?</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, If you ask what way God will turn the wrath of men againſt his people to his own praiſe: I anſwer, many ways; I ſhall but name them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Thereby the holineſs of God ſhall be the more exalted by the wrath of men: God ſpake in his holineſs, I will divide <hi>Shechem,</hi> and meaſure out the valley of <hi>Succoth:</hi> The holineſs of God, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men they are but diſhclouts for to make clean the Veſſels of the Sanctuary; but their wrath, and by their anger and rage, they ſhall make clean the Saints: Theſe diſhclouts ſhall make clean the Saints: Thus Gods holineſs ſhall be thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, ſo many Enemies, ſo many Schoolmaſters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thereby alſo the power of the Lord ſhall be declar'd and manifeſted, by the wrath and anger of wicked men againſt the people of God: Is it not a
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:45432:88"/> great deal of Gods power to preſerve the poor Saints in the midſt of all their rage; when wicked men have power, yet that the poor Saints ſhould be preſerved, hereby the power of the Lord is the more declared.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By the wrath and anger of wicked men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the anger and Juſtice of God is juſtified: Who will not juſtifie the anger of God againſt wicked men? when wicked men are ſo angry with his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; O this juſtifies the anger of God againſt them: why, you are angry with my children, and juſt therefore it is that I ſhould be angry with you.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thereby the patience of the Lord is magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If one ſhould ſtand by, and ſee a man ſmite his child; be very angry and wrathful, and ſmite his child, and not meddle, would not you ſay, This man were very patient. So, that God ſhould ſee ſo much anger againſt his own Children: O the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God is magnified, that can bear with wicked men in this manner!</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hereby alſo the Mercy, Grace, and goodneſs of the Lord is exalted. The free Grace and Mercy of God doth diſcover it ſelf, and is exalted both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards wicked men, and towards the Saints.</p>
               <p>The free Grace of God towards wicked men. God doth ſometimes convert wicked men in the midſt of their rage, wrath and malice againſt the Saints, witneſs <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Somtimes men are convinc'd by their very inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious dealings with the people of God. I remember in the Book of Martyrs, there's a ſtory of <hi>James Abbes,</hi> that was cruelly handled by his enemies: and when he was dead, the enemy was troubled in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and cryed out, I am damn'd, I am damn'd; <hi>James Abbes</hi> is ſav'd, and I am damn'd; <hi>James Abbes</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:45432:88"/> is ſav'd and I am damn'd. Men ſomtimes ſnore ſo loud in their ſleep, that they wake themſelves; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times men are converted, Jaylors converted, and Jaylors Relations converted by their unreaſonable dealings with the Saints and people of God.</p>
               <p>And hereby the grace and mercy of God is magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied towards his children: O that they ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the midſt of all the Rage and Malice of wicked and unreaſonable men; here's the grace and mercy of God towards them. Thus the goodneſs, mercy and grace of God is exalted, both towards wicked men, and towards good men.</p>
               <p>Again, From the wrath and anger of wicked men againſt the people of God, thereby the providence of God is very much magnified. <hi>Haman</hi> was very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and then <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſhould have bin cut off; And that night the King could not ſleep. Heres one providence.</p>
               <p>Well then, when he could not ſleep, he calls for the Records, (here's another Providence) and there he hits upon the place where there was mention made of the good deeds of <hi>Mordecai;</hi> and ſo <hi>Mordecai</hi> was ſpared. But thus the wrath and anger of men doth draw out the providence of God, and it is magnified thereby.</p>
               <p>Thereby alſo the Faithfulneſs of God is declared, and magnified, and manifeſted. The Faithfulneſs of God: for God hath threatned to deſtroy the enemies of his people, and hath promiſed to preſerve his people. When the enemies rage and are deſtroyed, God is faithful in fulfilling his threatnings: When the people of God are preſerved, God is faithful in his promiſe. Thus by letting out the rage and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of wicked men againſt the People of God, the faithfulneſs of God is magnified. And now is the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:45432:89"/> threatning fulfilled, God is faithful. Now is the promiſe fulfilled, God is faithful. And thus you ſee how the Lord doth turn the rage, and anger, and wrath of wicked men, and the men of the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own praiſe.</p>
               <p>But then ſecondly, What aſſurance have we of this? 'Tis a very comfortable thing, in the day of mens wrath and anger, that all this anger and wrath ſhould turn to Gods praiſe, or be reſtrained. But what aſſurance have we of this, that it ſhall be ſo?</p>
               <p>Aſſurance you have in the Text. <hi>Surely</hi> the wrath of man ſhall turn to his praiſe. That ſame word <hi>Surely.</hi> I but what aſſurance have we of it?</p>
               <p>'Tis very certain that God will be fearful in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. 'Tis certain, and very certain, that God will be above wicked men in the thing wherein they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves proudly. But beſides this,</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, You have the aſſurance of Chriſts Death and Merit. If you look upon the death of Chriſt, and the iſſues thereof, you may ſee it, and be aſſur'd of it. Was there ever more anger and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice let out upon any man, than upon Chriſt in his death? They were angry to the utmoſt: And did ever anger or malice turn more to the praiſe of God? What one thing was there that ever turned more to the praiſe of God than the death of Chriſt, and the anger and malice of thoſe that brought him to death? Why now Chriſt by his ſufferings hath merited this, That if we be conformable unto him in ſufferings; As his ſufferings, and as the wrath that brought him to ſuffer did turn to the praiſe of God; So that wrath that brings us to ſufferings, ſhall turn to the praiſe of God. This is a great matter, and here is much in it, and we may be aſſur'd on't, when we ſee and feel the wrath and anger of men, if we be conformable in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:45432:89"/> our ſufferings unto Chriſts ſufferings: Then as the wrath of men in bringing Chriſt to ſuffer, did turn to the praiſe of God; ſo the wrath of men, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Saints now to ſuffering, ſhall turn to the praiſe of God, you have the aſſurance of the death of Chriſt for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As you have the aſſurance of Chriſts death and merit for it, ſo you have the aſſurance of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deſign. God would not ſuffer men to be ſo wrathful and malicious againſt his people, if he did not intend to turn it unto his praiſe; God hath a deſign upon all their anger: God hath bid them to be angry (if I may ſo ſpeak) and why? if he had not a deſign to turn it to his praiſe? The Lord bid <hi>Shimei</hi> curſe <hi>David:</hi> Who was it that bid <hi>Shimei</hi> curſe <hi>David?</hi> God: And who was it that ſent <hi>Joſeph</hi> into <hi>Egypt?</hi> God ſent him: The wrath, and anger and envy of his Brethren indeed were inſtruments, but God ſent him. God had a deſign upon their anger, and upon their envy and wrath, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. you find that three unclean Spirits that came out of the mouth of the falſe Prophet, and Dragon, and the Beaſt, they ſtir up the Kings of the Earth to battel; and they are the Spirits of Devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the Kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to gather them to the battel of that great day of God Almighty. They go forth to ſtir up men to battel, but in <hi>verſe</hi> 16. 'tis <hi>God</hi> that gathers them: <hi>Behold I</hi> come as a Thief, bleſſed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, <hi>&amp;c. and he gathered them</hi> together into a place called in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue <hi>Armageddon:</hi> God had a hand upon their hand; God gathered them, in <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Now alſo many Nations are gathered againſt thee, that ſay: Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon</hi>

                  <hi>Zion.</hi> Let her be defiled, her's anger enough, but ſaith he, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. <hi>They know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither underſtand they his counſel; For he ſhall gather them as the ſheaves into the floor. He</hi> ſhall gather them, in the 11th. <hi>verſe,</hi> 'tis ſaid: Now alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations are gathered againſt thee, that ſay, let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon <hi>Zion;</hi> But they know not the thoughts of the Lord: They are gathering together againſt the people of God; and <hi>God</hi> is gathering to threſh them: <hi>They</hi> gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>God</hi> hath a deſign upon their gathering; <hi>God gathers</hi> them: So in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38. you have there the ſtory of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> that came up againſt the people of the Lord in a great multitude; and they came up to ſpoil: Therefore <hi>verſe</hi> 14. Son of man propheſie, and ſay unto <hi>Gog,</hi> Thus ſaith the Lord God, in that day, when my people <hi>Iſrael</hi> dwelleth ſafely, ſhalt thou not know it? and thou ſhalt come from thy place, out of the North parts, Thou and many people with thee, all of them riding upon Horſes, a great company, and a mighty Army, and thou ſhalt come againſt my people <hi>Iſrael</hi> as a cloud, to cover the Land, it ſhall be in the latter daies: And <hi>I will bring</hi> thee againſt my Land; Why? That the Heathen may know me, when I ſhall be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in thee O <hi>Gog</hi> before their eyes, <hi>verſe</hi> 11. Thou ſhalt ſay, <hi>I will go up</hi> to the Land of unwalled Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, <hi>I will go</hi> to them that are at reſt, that dwell ſafely, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to take a ſpoil, and to take a prey; But ſee, the Lord hath another deſign, <hi>Thou ſhalt come up againſt my people</hi> Iſrael, <hi>as a cloud to cover the Land, it ſhall be in the latter daies, and I will bring thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Land:</hi> Why? <hi>That the Heathen may know me, when I ſhall be ſanctified in thee, O</hi> Gog, <hi>before their eyes:</hi> And in <hi>verſe</hi> 23. <hi>Thus will I magnifie my</hi>

                  <hi>ſelf, and ſanctifie my ſelf, and I will be known in the eyes of many Nations, and they ſhall know that I am the Lord.</hi> Here's Gods deſign, God doth let out the wrath and anger of wicked men againſt his people, and he hath this deſign, that his Name may be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified: So that you have this aſſurance alſo, the great deſign of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You have the aſſurance of Gods Zeal: The zeal of the Lord of Hoſts ſhall do this: The God whom we ſerve is a zealous God. Zeal is angered Love. Now there are three things that God doth love eſpecially. He loves his Truth; he loves his Worſhip; and he loves his People. When wicked men do prevail againſt the People of God, They ſcorn the Truth, they defile his Worſhip, they perſecute his People: I ſay, theſe three things God loves in the World. But now God will not ſuffer theſe things that he loves thus, to be alwaies tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on: for he is a zealous God, and therefore you may build upon it, you may be aſſured of it: That either he will reſtrain the rage of men, or he will turn their Wrath and Anger unto his own Praiſe.</p>
               <p>But then, Thirdly, Suppoſe all this: What is our Duty that doth flow from hence?</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, if that there be ſuch a deal of anger and wrath in the hearts of men againſt the Saints and people of God; wonder not at it, be not offended when you ſee it: it was alwaies ſo from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: God hath put enmity, and the enmity that God hath put between the ſeeds, ſhall ſtand; <hi>Cain</hi> began betime, and as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith <hi>Cain</hi> will be killing his Brother <hi>Abel</hi> to the worlds end: It hath alwaies been ſo, and do you think there ſhall be leſs anger in the hearts of the men of the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

                  </gap> now. <hi>Anſtin</hi> thinks that the anger, and wrath, and perſecution of the wicked, will be greateſt at the laſt: ſaith he, The perſecution of the Primitive times was very ſharp: But afterwards there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the perſecution of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and that was ſharp: But the laſt perſecution, is the Perſecution of Antichriſt, and that ſhall be the ſharpeſt: And we find in the 11th of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> ſpeaking of the latter daies, That <hi>the Nations are angry,</hi> verſe 18. <hi>And the Nations were angry, and thy wrath is come.</hi> That's well, Gods wrath goes with their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: But the Nations were angry, ſpeaking of the latter daies. There are three or four things that will raiſe the anger and wrath of Antichriſt in the latter daies.</p>
               <p>There is the Propheſying of the Witneſſes: The Witneſſes Propheſie, and when they have finiſhed their Propheſie, the Beaſt ſhall kill them; and being ſlain, they ſhall make merry over the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that Propheſied, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. and rejoyce over them, and ſhall ſend gifts one to another: Why, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe two Prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth; the Proteſtants and reformed Churches do torment by t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r propheſie. So that there is one thing that doth image them.</p>
               <p>Another thing that doth raiſe the anger of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian party <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> the world in the latter daies, is the ſeparation: For there ſhall be the greateſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:45432:91"/> that ever was, <hi>Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</hi> There ſhall be the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſt ſeparation, and that provokes them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another thing that ſhall provoke the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian party in the latter daies is this: That they ſhall power forth the vials: The Angels that come out of the Temple, they ſhall have an hand in pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the vials: And what then? Why then, the men of the world, they ſhall be tormented, and gnaſh their teeth, and bite their tongues for pain. The pouring out of the vials is another thing were-in they ſhall be inſtrumental for the angering of the Beſtial party. But then the</p>
               <p>Fourth thing is, The ſetting up the Kingdom of Chriſt: So you have it in <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. The ſeventh Angel ſounded, and there were great voices in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying: The Kingdoms of this world are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign for ever and ever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What then? <hi>And the Nations were angry.</hi> When Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom comes to be ſet up, then the Nations are angry: 'Tis the ſetting up the Kingdom of Chriſt that angers the Nations: and therefore in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Pſalm,</hi> W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y do the Heathen rage, and the Kings and Princes take counſel together? It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, I will ſet my King upon his holy Hill, I will ſet up my Kingdom, and the Kingdom of Chriſt ſhall be ſetup, for all they are ſo angry at it; I will do it: But this is another thing that ſhall raiſe the anger of the men of the world in the latter daies. I but is this ſo, that there is ſuch a deal of anger and wrath in the hearts of the wicked againſt the people of God? Be not offended at it, it alwaies was ſo, and it muſt be ſo in the latter daies.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:45432:92"/>
               <p> But Secondly, If there be ſo much wrath and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the hearts of wicked men againſt the Saints, Why ſhould we not all make ſure of the love of Chriſt? O the Love of God in Chriſt will weigh down mens anger! What need I care though <hi>men</hi> be angry, if <hi>God</hi> love me; though men frown, ſo God ſmile: If God be angry, and wicked men an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry too, how ſhall we bear that? how ſhall we ſtand under that? Wicked men are angry, and full of anger, and 'tis a perſecuting time, and wicked men are very angry againſt the Saints, if God be angry too, how ſhall we bear it? Therefore labour to make ſure of the Love of God in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If that the wrath and anger of wicked men ſhall turn to the praiſe of God, Why ſhould we fear when wicked men are angry? why ſhould we be afraid? When men are angry, we are apt to fear, but in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51. <hi>Who art thou that art afraid of a man that ſhall dye, and of the Son of man that ſhall be made as graſs: and forgetteſt the Lord thy Maker, that hath ſtretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth?</hi> &amp;c. Who art thou that art afraid of a <hi>man that ſhall dye?</hi> Is that all the Argument? There's another Argument before, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>Hearken unto me ye that know Righteouſneſs, the people in whoſe heart is my Law, fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings:</hi> why? <hi>for the Moth ſhall eat them up like a garment:</hi> They ſhall eat out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as the Moth eats out her ſelf: <hi>For the Moth ſhall eat them up like a Garment, and the Worm ſhall eat them like Wool; But my Righteouſneſſe,</hi> the Goſpel of my Righteouſneſs, and the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, that's my Righteouſneſs, <hi>ſhall be for ever,</hi> and my ſalvation, <hi>from Generation to Generation.</hi> Fear not, why God will turn all their wrath and anger
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:45432:92"/> unto his praiſe. And therefore why ſhould we fear.</p>
               <p>But fourthly, If God will turn the wrath and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of wicked men unto his own praiſe, why ſhould we not be contented, ſatisfied, and comforted under all the rage and malice of unreaſonable men in ſuch a day as this?</p>
               <p>Will you ſay, O but they are not only angry, but they are furious. Why their fury ſhall turn to the Lords praiſe.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, O but they are not only furious, but they hate, and they are enraged, and their rage aſcends up to Heaven. All this ſhall turn to Gods praiſe.</p>
               <p>Their great deſign is to damp the Spirits of the People of God. But they waxed bold by my bonds, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of the Saints.</p>
               <p>Their great deſign is to ſcatter the people of God: But by the ſcattering of Gods People ſhall his truth be ſcattered. They ſcatter Gods people, and Gods people ſcatter Gods truth; it ſhall turn to his praiſe.</p>
               <p>Their great deſign is to deſtroy the Goſpel, to ſuppreſs the Goſpel: But ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> my bonds turned to the furtherance of the Goſpel. Thus God will work it to his praiſe. And therefore when you ſee the wrath, anger, and malice of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, breaking out to ſuch Perſecution; be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, be contented, be ſatisfied, be comforted; all this ſhall God turn to his praiſe, or he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain it.</p>
               <p>But then fifthly, If theſe things be ſo, why ſhould we not now ſtand ſtill and behold the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God? See what God will do, expect the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:45432:93"/> of all this, 'tis a day of anger, 'tis a day of great wrath, there is abundance of anger and wrath, and hatred and malice in the hearts of men againſt the people of God at this day, who doth not ſee it? Well then Friends, ſtand ſtill; you know how an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was when he followed after the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites; and ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſtand ſtill and ſee the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God. So ſay I, you ſhall ſee all this turn to Gods praiſe: You ſhall ſee the reſtraining of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, turn to the inlarging of Prayer: You ſhall ſee the ſeeking to ſuppreſs the Goſpel, turn to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Now in ſuch a day as this, be righteous in your places, For ſaith the Lord, ſay to the Righteous, It ſhall go well with him. Say! Who ſhould ſay it? Why, Miniſters ſay it, Chriſtians ſay it one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Let every man ſay to himſelf. Say to the Righteous, It ſhall go well with him; therefore be righteous in ſuch a day as this.</p>
               <p>And then ſecondly, Fear before the Lord: In ſuch a day of Anger be ſure that you fear, and fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord. Look what is ſaid in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Though a ſinner do evil an hundred times, and his daies be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, yet ſurely I know that it ſhall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him.</hi> That fear before him: Whats that? That is, a man that fears the Lord, walking up and down in the preſence of God.</p>
               <p>But what Caſe doth he ſpeak to?</p>
               <p>Look into the 9th verſe, There is a time (ſaith he) wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt: and (ſaith he) becauſe they rule thus, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt wicked men is not executed ſpeedily, but they go on and proſper in their rule and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:45432:93"/> therefore the heart of the Sons of men is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet in them to do evil: But ſaith he, <hi>Though a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner do evil an hundred times, and his dayes be prolonged, yet ſurely I know that it ſhall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him.</hi> Be ſure therefore that you fear the Lord, and that you fear before him; and the more you fear God, and fear before him, the leſs will you fear men.</p>
               <p>But then thirdly (and ſo I end). Now in ſuch a time, give your ſelf much to prayer. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. 4. <hi>For my Love they are mine Adverſaries, but I give my ſelf unto Prayer.</hi> So you read it, But <hi>I Prayer. I give my ſelf unto,</hi> is not in the Hebrew, but, <hi>I Prayer;</hi> the ſence is good enough. For my love they are my Adverſaries, but I give my ſelf to Prayer. Now in ſuch a time as this, when they are angry, and their rage aſcends up to Heaven; now do I go to prayer, now do I give my ſelf to prayer. Now then, if it be an angry day with the enemies, now go to Prayer. And in all your Prayers in reference to mens anger and malice, when you go and ſpread their anger and malice before the great God, aim more at your duty, than at your ſafety. Look into that fourth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> there you find that they were angry; <hi>Why do the Heathen Rage,</hi> v. 25. (They bring the ſecond <hi>Pſalm</hi> to their purpoſe) <hi>And the people imagine a vain thing, The Kings of the Earth ſtood up;</hi> being at Prayer, at v. 29. <hi>And now Lord behold their threatnings.</hi> They ſpread their threatnings before the Lord: <hi>And now Lord behold their threatnings, and grant unto thy ſervants.</hi> What, gran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſafety? No, <hi>Grant unto thy ſervants, that with all boldneſs they may ſpeak thy Word:</hi> Its matter of Duty that they pray for. What then? <hi>And when they had prayed, the place was ſhaken where they were Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:45432:94"/> 
                  <hi>together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and they ſpake the Word of God with boldneſs.</hi> Here was Prayer anſwered preſently; they Prayed, and in their prayer, their mind was more upon their duty than upon their ſafety. They go to God, and ſpread the threatnings of the enemies before the Lord. And now Lord behold their threatnings. And what then? Now grant that with all boldneſs: Lets beg Grace to do our Duty. They begged not for ſafety, but their great requeſt was, That they might have grace to do their duty. So I ſay, when men are angry: Now let us go to God in Prayer, and in all our Prayers, ſpreading their anger and threatnings before the Lord. Yet let our mind be more upon our duty, than upon our ſafety.</p>

               <p>The Cauſe, and Fountain, and Original of all theſe Mercies: The mighty Preſence of the Lord, and his Love unto his People, <hi>verſe</hi> 15. The King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even the Lord, is in the midſt of thee, Thou ſhalt not ſee evil any more, <hi>verſe</hi> 17.

               <p>As for the perſons that theſe promiſed Mercies are intailed upon, they are poor afflicted people that truſt in the Name of the Lord: The people

               <p>From whence then I take up this Obſervation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> Though God doth ſometimes ſuffer the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſembly to lye under reproach, yet if his people are fully ſenſible of that reproach, God will turn their former miſeries into after mercies; And he will cauſe their future comforts to run parallel unto their former troubles.

               <p>Firſt, That God doth ſometimes ſuffer the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſembly to lye under reproach.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That then thoſe that are true members of the Solemn Aſſembly, thoſe be very ſenſible of it, carry it as their burthen.</p>

               <p>Firſt, We muſt enquire, when the Solemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly may be ſaid to lie under reproach? And</p>
               <p>Secondly, Why God doth ſuffer the Solemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to lye under reproach at any time?</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Firſt of all, If you ask, when the Solemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly may be ſaid to lye under reproach?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer: Look when the Preſence of God is departed from the publick Ordinances, or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſembly, then the Solemn Aſſembly doth lye under reproach. The Preſence of God in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ordinances or Solemn Aſſembly, is the glory
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:45432:96"/> of the Aſſembly, and when that glory is departed, the Solemn Aſſembly lies under reproach: though the Word of God be preached in an Aſſembly, if the Converting, Sanctifying Comforting Preſence of God be gone out of the Ordinance, and be not there, it lies under reproach: And though there be Government in a Church, yet if Gods Preſence be not in that Government, it lies under reproach, and the Church lies under reproach: That's the firſt: Look when the Preſence of God is depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Solemn Aſſembly, then it lies under Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Look when a Reformation hath been intended, and cannot be accompliſh'd, but is ſtaid and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, then the Solemn Aſſembly lies under Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.

Look therefore when a Church or People have been travelling with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and that Reformation proves abortive, ſtopt and hindred, then that Church and People, or Solemn Aſſembly lye under Reproach. But</p>
               <p n="3">3. And eſpecially: Look when the waies of <hi>Zion</hi> mourn, and are unfrequented, then doth the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſembly lye under Reproach, when the waies of <hi>Sion</hi> mourn and are not frequented: It was the caſe that this Prophet ſpeaks of: he ſpeaks of the Captivity of <hi>Babilon,</hi> the time of the Captivity, what then? why ſaith the Church in the <hi>Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> the waies of <hi>Zion</hi> mourn, and are not frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: When the waies of <hi>Zion</hi> mourn and are not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, the people of God are kept from coming together according unto Gods appointment; Then the Solemn Aſſembly lies under reproach: You

And laſtly, Look when the ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Solemn Aſſembly is ſuch, as that no man cares for it, nor ſeeks for it, then it lies under Reproach: Such a ſtate ſometimes the Solemn Aſſembly falls into: <hi>This is</hi> Zion <hi>whom no man ſeeketh after;</hi> This is <hi>Zion</hi> whom no man careth for: The Magiſtrate doth not care for it to countenance it: It hath no friends for to help it: if you ſee a poor man in the ſtreets, neglected, none cares for him, none countenances him, none looks after him to care for him, and to help him: You ſay he lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Reproach. So when the Solemn Aſſembly is in ſuch a caſe and condition, that none cares for it, nor ſeeks for the welfare of it: Thoſe that are in place, eſpecially, then the Solemn Aſſembly lies under Reproach.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But then Secondly, Why doth God ſuffer the Solemn Aſſembly to lye under Reproach at any time?</p>
               <p n="1">1. He will ſometimes ſuffer the Solemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to lie under Reproach, that he may roll away the Reproach from off the Aſſembly. There is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly. There is a ſinful Reproach, and there is a penal Reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the Members of the Solemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly are acceſſary to the Reproach of the Solemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:45432:97"/> As ſometimes they walk and live ſo, as that they are a ſcandal to the very Ordinances: So it is ſaid of the Sons of <hi>Ely,</hi> ſining at the door of the Tabernacle, they made the Sacrifice of God to ſtink. Poſſibly Profeſſors may ſo walk as to make the Sacrifice of God to ſtink, and are ſo acceſſary unto the Reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Sometimes again they are exceeding barren, and unfruitful under the injoyment of the Solemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. The Hebrews call the Winter <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which ſignifies <hi>Reproach,</hi> for (ſay they) the Winter is the Reproach of the Earth, becauſe there is no fruit, nothing but barrenneſs, and unfruitfulneſs: and therefore they call the Winter by ſuch a name as ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies Reproach. What a Reproach was it to <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> to be barren: barren women accounted it a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, ſo Reproachful is a barren life among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors.</p>
               <p>Sometimes again, The Members of the Solemn Aſſembly, they do bear themſelves out in their ſins upon their enjoyment of the Solemn Aſſembly; crying out the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, and are we not delivered to do all theſe abominations. There is a two-fold bearing of our ſelves upon the Solemn Aſſembly. There is a bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ſelves upon the Solemn Aſſembly, and upon the publick Ordinances in oppoſition unto falſe worſhipers; So in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. <hi>Abijah</hi> bears himſelf upon the Solemn Aſſembly, in oppoſition unto <hi>Jeroboams</hi> falſe worſhip: <hi>But as for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not forſaken him, and the Prieſts which miniſter unto the Lord, are the Sons of</hi> Aaron, <hi>and the Levites wait upon their buſineſs: And they burn unto the Lord every morning, and every evening, burnt Sacrifices and ſweet Incenſe; The Shewbread alſo ſet</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:45432:98"/> 
                  <hi>they in order upon the pure Table, and the Candleſtick of Gold with the Lamps thereof, to burn every evening; for we kept the charge of the Lord our God, but ye have forſaken him.</hi> Thus they did bear themſelves, and this was not their Reproach, but their Faith, in <hi>verſe</hi> 18. <hi>Thus</hi> the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were brought under at that time, and the Children of <hi>Judah</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, <hi>becauſe they relyed upon the Lord God of their Fathers.</hi> They did bear themſelves upon the Solemn Aſſembly, and their pure injoyments therein, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opſit on to falſe worſhip; this was no Reproach. But then there is a bearing of our ſelves upon the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſembly, ſo as to bear us out in our ſin, to cry, The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord; Sin and live wickedly, and bear our ſelves out upon a Solemn Aſſembly, that we are Members of a Church <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is a Reproach: <hi>This</hi> bearing ones ſelf, upon the Solemn Aſſembly is a Reproach: And ſaith <hi>Chryſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>m,</hi> who would not be moved to hear the Blaſphemings and Revilings of the Jews a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt? But O Chriſtian (ſaith he) take heed thou beeſt not guilty of the ſame fault; for he that defiles the Kings Garment, and he that tears the Kings Garment offends alike. The Jews tear it, ſcandalous Chriſtians they defile the Garment of Chriſt, the Sins are divers, but the Reproach the ſame (ſaith he.) Now then, you ſee that ſometimes the Members of the Solemn Aſſembly do bring a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; They are acceſſary: God knows how to roll away a Reproach by a Reproach: and God will ſometimes roll away ſinful Reproach by a penal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach: And therefore he doth ſuffer the Solemn Aſſembly ſometimes to lie under a Reproach.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What if God have ſome great deſign and work to bring to paſs, which in an ordinary way he
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:45432:98"/> cannot bring to paſs, but through the Reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly? Suppoſe that the Lord be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for to ſcatter and diſperſe the Truth, and the Goſpel; how will he do this but by ſcattering his people that are of the Solemn Aſſembly? The Church was ſcattered in the 8th. of the <hi>Acts:</hi> What then? they went up and down preaching every where, they came to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord, and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there a whole year preaching, and there thoſe that believed were firſt called Chriſtians: By their ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, Truth and the Goſpel ſcattered.</p>
               <p>But then, Thirdly, what if God will try his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and his friends, both at once? Sometimes he will try his enemies, whether they will dare to break open his Houſe, to trample his holy City under foot: Whether they will behave themſelves proudly: Sometimes he will try them. Sometimes he will try his own Children, how they will ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry it in ſuch a day, whether they will lament after God, how they will be affected for the want of the publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; God will try ſometimes his own Children, and where doth God try his Children but in that thing, wherein they are much delighted? what's that? One thing have I deſired of the Lord, which I will for ever deſire, that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord: here's their delight, here's their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, here God will try them.</p>
               <p>But Fourthly, What if the Lord will make the Solemn Aſſembly more glorious than ever it was? he hath promiſed to do it, To make the Place of his feet more glorious; that the light of the Moon ſhall be as the light of the Sun, and the light of one day as of ſeven daies: He will make the Solemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more glorious: How ſo? but by bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ging one
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:45432:99"/> contrary out of another: when did God ever put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great life into any buſineſs, but at firſt he put the ſentence of death upon it? When did God ever give any great repute or honour to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> to <hi>Mordecai,</hi> but firſt they were brought under Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach: ſaith our Saviour Chriſt, unleſs the ſeed dies, it abides alone, but if it die it brings forth much fruit, So with Chriſt, ſo with the Saints; in the 26th. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as with himſelf it was, ſo it ſhall be with his, <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, together with my dead body ſhall they ariſe.</hi> Bodies once dead and raiſed again, are the moſt glorious. Now God doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make the Solemn Aſſembly more glorious than ever: No wonder therefore that he doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, (being this is his way and method) ſuffer the Solemn Aſſembly to lye under Reproach. So then, you have the firſt thing cleared in two particulars.</p>
               <p>But then Secondly: Suppoſe the Solemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly do lye under Reproach: How will the members of the Solemn Aſſembly take it, or be affected with it?</p>
               <p>Why the Members of the Solemn Aſſembly are of two ſorts: There are falſe Members, and there are true Members.</p>
               <p>Some are true Members of the Church, <hi>If ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in my Word, then are ye my Diſciples indeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some are falſe Members of the Church: <hi>They went out from us, becauſe they were not of us.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 19. theſe latter when the Solemn Aſſembly lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Reproach, they will not be much grieved, but rather ſay, down with it, down with it even to the ground, (with the Children of <hi>Edom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the former, that are the true Members of the Solemn Aſſembly, The Saints and people of God, They will be much affected, ſaith the Text, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:45432:99"/> I will gather them that are ſorrowful for the Solemn Aſſembly, who <hi>are of thee, To whom the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of it is a burthen:</hi> Theſe will be much affected, and very ſenſible of the Reproach of the Solemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, in <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. We read of ſome certain men that were defiled by a dead body, and they were mightily troubled that they were kept from the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over from <hi>one</hi> Ordinance, <hi>verſe</hi> 6, 7. Yet the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſembly ſtood: how would they have been affected if the Solemn Aſſembly it ſelf had lain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Reproach, in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 42. You ſee <hi>David</hi> is much affected when he was kept from the houſe of God: yet the Solemn Aſſembly ſtood. How would he have been affected if the Solemn Aſſembly it ſelf had lain under Reproach. When the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſembly doth lie under Reproach, thoſe that are the true Members of the Church and Solemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, the Saints and people of God in truth, they will be much affected and ſenſible thereof, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Reproach up and down with them as their burthen.</p>
               <p>You will ſay How, and Why?</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How will the Saints and People of God be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected when the Solemn Aſſembly lies under Reproach?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer Negatively Firſt, They will not be ſo affected with the Reproach of the Solemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly as to be uncapable of the Teachings of God. It's ſaid of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they did not hear <hi>Moſes</hi> for anguiſh: ſo the Saints and People of God will not be affected when the Solemn Aſſembly lies under Reproach, for they will learn thereby.</p>
               <p>Neither will they be affected with the Reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly, as to be unthankful for what they have, 'tis thy Mercy that we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed: True, The Solemn Aſſembly lyes under Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:45432:100"/> but it is a Mercy of Mercies we have that liberty we have.</p>
               <p>Nor will they be ſo affected with the Reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly as if it were barely their own concernment: Not barely as their own concernment: 'Tis true, they are much more concerned in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Solemn Aſſembly than others, but they are not affected upon this account, meerly becauſe it is their own concernment.</p>

               <p n="2">2. This affection of theirs will continue with them, and abide upon them: they will not hang down their heads for a day, and frolick it afterwards; hang down their heads for a day in a Faſt, but as it

               <p>And the Saints and people of God, they are well pleaſed in this ſenſe.

               <p>But Thirdly, Then the Name of the Lord is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured: The Reproaches of them that Reproached <hi>thee have fallen upon me:</hi> And ſo the other way; The Reproaches of them that Reproach us, and the Solemn Aſſemblies, are fallen <hi>upon thee</hi> O Lord, and upon thy Name.

When the Solemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly is under Reproach, his <hi>Truth is derided,</hi> his <hi>Worſhip defiled,</hi> his <hi>Children perſecuted,</hi> and his <hi>Name diſhonoured:</hi> Who can behold all theſe things and not bleed; and not be affected there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? That's a third.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Look when the Solemn Aſſembly doth lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Reproach, then all the People of God, the whole Generation of the Righteous are afflicted, diſtreſſed, and as a Lamp deſpiſed before him, that is at eaſe: Who would not grieve to ſee the necks of all the people of God lye upon the block toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ready to be cut off? Pray do but mind that place in <hi>Eſther,</hi> 'Tis ſaid there, that when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree came out upon the Jews, that their necks lay all upon the block, in the third of <hi>Eſther, The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree was given in</hi> Shuſhan <hi>the Palace, and the King and</hi> Haman <hi>ſate down to drink, but the City</hi> Shuſhan <hi>was perplexed:</hi> The <hi>City Shuſhan,</hi> Why the <hi>City Shuſhan?</hi> 'Tis not ſaid the <hi>Jews:</hi> What was the <hi>City Shuſhan, Jews?</hi> No, there were a hundred to one in the City,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45432:102"/> that were no Jews, I, but the Neighbours of the people of God were perplexed. O then, is the <hi>City Suſhan</hi> perplext in ſuch a day? and ſhall not the Jews themſelves be perplext? ſhall they not be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected much with it? Then all the Saints, their necks lie upon the block. Look but into the Pſalms, and you ſhall ſee that when the Temple of God is defiled, <hi>The reproach of the houſe of God, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the Saints go together,</hi> Pſal. 79. 1, 2. <hi>O God, the Heathen are come into thine Inheritance, thy Holy Temple have they defiled, they have laid Jeruſalem on heaps; the dead bodies of thy Servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the Heaven, the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſh of thy Saints unto the beaſts of the earth, their bloud have they ſhed like water round about Jeruſalem, and there was none to bury them, we are become a reproach to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi> I, theſe two go together, the defilement of the houſe of God, the reproach of the Solemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and the perſecution of the Saints like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Now who can ſee theſe things and not be affected?</p>
               <p n="5">5. The School-men ſay, That power which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reſiſted, is a cauſe of grief. If evil be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and I be able to reſiſt it, I am not much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: but if evil comes like an armed man, and I cannot reſiſt it, this cauſeth grief. Now when the Solemn Aſſemblie lies under Reproach, evil comes upon the People of God like an armed man: They cannot reſiſt it, hear's grief then.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>School-men</hi> ſay, All grief doth ariſe from the want of the thing loved, and the loſs of good: Now when the Solemn Aſſembly doth lie under Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, there good things are loſt; the Saints good things: There's the preſence of God in the Solemn
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:45432:103"/> Aſſembly: There's the Chariot whereby Chriſt rides into the ſouls of ſinners: There's the food of Faith: There's all good things gone, and therefore no wonder they are ſo affected: But</p>
               <p n="7">7. Look when the Solemn Aſſembly doth lie un-under Reproach, then the world is ſcandalized, and the world's offended. <hi>Wo to the world becauſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ffences,</hi> 'tis an evil thing that the world ſhould be offended. When is the world offended? when the Solemn Aſſembly lies under Reproach? aha, ſo would we have it: Then they laugh, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> who is offended, and I burn not. We ſay, when the ſick man laughs, the Phyſician crys, he is diſtracted ſaith he. Why now the Saints and People of God, they are the worlds Phyſicians to cure them, and heal them, by their lives, and prayers, and inſtructions. What do they laugh? what do they ſay? Aha, ſo would we have it. But when the Solemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly lies under Reproach, then is the world offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Then therefore is the time for the Saints and people of God to be much affected.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Look when the Solemn Aſſembly doth lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Reproach, then the Devil gets up again: The Devil falls by the powerful preaching of the Goſpel, ſaith our Saviour Chriſt. Rejoyce not that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils fall down like lightning before you. What fall? what doth our Saviour Chriſt ſpeak of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils firſt fall? no ſurely, but of his fall by the preaching of the Goſpel. When the Goſpel is powerfully preached, then the Devil falls: But when the Solemn Aſſembly lies under Reproach, he gets up again: And what good man would not grieve, when he ſees how the Devil gets up again? eſpecially if he have ſeen the falling of the Devil before?</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:45432:103"/> 9. Look when the Solemn Aſſembly doth lie under Reproach, then you have a certain preſage of a Famine of the hearing of the word. If one could aſſure you, that for certain there would be a Famine of Bread, you would be much affected. Why the reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly is a certain preſage of a Famine of the word, and the hearing of the word, a certain preſage of it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The more that any good man hath any hand in any great evil that is come, the more he is affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there withall. 'Tis fabled of the <hi>Eagle,</hi> that when the Eagle was ſhot, looking upon her wound, ſhe was troubled: But when ſhe lookt upon the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and ſaw the feathers of the Arrow; nay then ſaith ſhe, I am kill'd, and am deſtroyed by ſome of my own kind, in regard of the feathers; and this wounded her again, and troubled her more, that ſhe was deſtroyed by ſome of her own kind. And truly, when a good man looks upon the reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly, may he not ſee his own feathers? Yes, This reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly have I had a hand in. No wonder therefore that it doth grieve him, and that he is much affected.</p>
               <p n="11">11. When the Solemn Aſſembly doth lie under reproach, God is departed. <hi>Take away God, and I am no body</hi> ſaith one. A good heart will alwayes ſay ſo: Take away God, and I am no body. Now when the reproach lies upon the Solemn Aſſembly, then God is gone. God is ſo much departed, and ſo much gone, as the Solemn Aſſembly lies under reproach; ſo much we do bear the badges of Gods departure.</p>
               <p>Do you then ask me, what there is in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Solemn Aſſembly, that the Saints ſhould be ſo much affected there withall? There
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:45432:104"/> are theſe two things, and judge you whether there be not cauſe, that all the Saints and people of God ſhould be much affected, and carry it as a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then upon their ſouls, when the Solemn Aſſembly lies under reproach? And thus I have done with the ſecond thing, that <hi>thoſe that are of them:</hi> Thoſe that are the true Members of the Solemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, they will be very ſenſible of it: And you ſee the reaſons of it.</p>
               <p>But Thirdly, Suppoſe the Solemn Aſſembly do lie under reproach; and we have been, and are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſible thereof, and carry it as a burthen: What then?</p>
               <p>Then will the Lord turn your former ſorrow into future comforts: Then will the Lord return unto you with joy: Then ſhall you certainly be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and God will make your after-comforts, to run Parallel with your former troubles. <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted: Thoſe that ſow in tears, they ſhall reap in joy.</hi> As ſurely as now you go forth, carrying precious ſeed; the ſenſe of this condition upon your hearts, you ſhall return again with your ſheaves of joy with you.</p>
               <p>But wherein lies this Parallel? and how ſhall our after-comforts run Parallel with our former trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, in caſe we be thus ſenſible?</p>
               <p>The Scripture tells you; Firſt of all, in caſe that you have been ſcattered in the day of the reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly: In caſe you have been ſcattered, then the Lord will gather you, your ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering ſhall anſwer to your ſcattering. I will <hi>gather</hi> them that are ſorrowful, <hi>gather,</hi> he will gather you under his wings, as a Hen gathers her Chickens. <hi>O Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>How often would I have gathered thy Children together, as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under</hi>

                  <hi>her wings:</hi> Gather you, as a ſhepherd gathers his ſheep into his fold, and he will gather you into his boſom; and therefore ſaith our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in.</hi> The word is, you gathered me. <hi>I was a ſtranger, and</hi> ye gathered me not. Why? becauſe when the Lord gathers, then he takes us in, and receives us into his boſom: So that in caſe you have been ſcattered, then will the Lord gather you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In caſe that you have halted in the day of the Solemn Aſſembly, then will the Lord heal you. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, ſaith he, <hi>I will ſave her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out.</hi> Mark, there's a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in it, if that you be ſenſible of the reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly: I will ſave her that halteth, <hi>halthing</hi> notes weakneſs. I will ſtrengthen you in oppoſition to all your weakneſs. <hi>Halting</hi> notes an <hi>uneven</hi> courſe: A man that halts inclines this way, and inclines that way; ſometimes he bends to the right ſide, and ſometimes to the left: So when men halt in matters of Religion, how long will ye halt between two Opinions, ſometimes he bends this way to the truth, and ſometimes that way againſt truth: Now in oppoſition to all this uneven courſe of yours, ſaith the Lord, I will heal her that halteth: Though thou haſt halted in the day of the reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly, yet I will heal thee, and I will ſave thee, ſaith the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In caſe that you have ſuffered reproach in the reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly, ſaith the Lord, in the 19 <hi>ver. I will get them praiſe and fame in every land, where they have been put to ſhame.</hi> Have you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered reproach in the day of the reproach of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſembly, have you ſuffered reproach? <hi>I will get you fame and praiſe;</hi> yea I will get you fame and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:45432:105"/> praiſe <hi>in the very place</hi> where you have ſuffered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, ye <hi>in all</hi> the places where you have ſuffered reproach.</p>
               <p>And ſaith he in the laſt verſe, <hi>When I turn back your Captivity before your eyes.</hi> Sometimes a mans name is vindicated when he is dead; God vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates him from reproach when he is dead: But ſaith he, <hi>I will get you fame and praiſe, even before your eyes; In the very places where you have been put to ſhame, there</hi> will I get you fame and name, and your eyes ſhall ſee this: So that thus then you ſee the Parallel; If that the Saints and people of God be ſenſible of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Solemn Aſſembly, God will turn their former Miſeries, into after Mercies, and he will cauſe their after Comforts to run parallel with their former trouble.</p>
               <p>By way of Application then:</p>
               <p>If theſe things be ſo. Firſt, rejoyce not over us O our enemies; for though we be fallen, yet we ſhall riſe again. Speak no more arrogantly O ye Children of man, though the righteous fall ſeven times, he ſhall riſe again.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this Doctrine be true, what a mighty dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is here between a godly man, and a wicked man, in reference to his dealings with God, and God's dealing with him? In reference to his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with God, a wicked man looks upon a Solemn Aſſembly with an evil eye, and it is his burthen, he crys, The burthen of the Lord, the burthen of the Lord: A good man looks upon the reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly as his burthen. <hi>The Solemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly it ſelf</hi> is a burthen to a wicked man, the <hi>reproach</hi> of it is a burthen to a good man. Well now, as for the wicked, his laughter ſhall be turned into mourning; as for the godly, his mourning ſhall be turned into comfort.</p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:45432:105"/>
               <p> But thirdly, If this Doctrine be true, what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of comfort is here, for all you that have been ſenſible of the Reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly? It cannot be denied, but this day the Solemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly lies under Reproach; then you that have carried this Reproach up and down with you as your burthen, and have been ſenſible of this Reproach of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem Aſſembly, be of good comfort, the Lord will turn your preſent Miſeries into future Mercies; the Lord will cauſe your after comforts, to run paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel with your preſent troubles.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, this comfort doth relate to the future, but I have none for the preſent.</p>
               <p>Yes, you know 'tis ſaid, the Lord comforteth <hi>in all</hi> our tribulations; 'tis not ſaid <hi>after</hi> our tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, but <hi>in</hi> them: There is comfort in our tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations; Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit, for theirs <hi>is</hi> the Kingdom of God: Bleſſed are thoſe that <hi>mourn,</hi> they <hi>ſhall</hi> be comforted: and bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they <hi>ſhall</hi> ſee God: But bleſſed are the poor in Spirit, for theirs <hi>is</hi> the Kingdom of God: So that here's comfort for the preſent.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, All this comfort hangs upon a condition, This Promiſe doth run conditionally. Here's a great Promiſe of comfort indeed, but it is upon condition, being ſenſible of the Reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly, and <hi>I have not</hi> been ſenſible, and <hi>I am not</hi> ſenſible.</p>
               <p>No, pray ſtay a little: Not ſenſible! It may be you are not ſenſible of your ſenſe: As a man may be ſenſible of his unſenſibleneſs, ſo a man may be unſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his ſenſe: As a man may not believe that he doth believe; So a man may not be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nſible of the ſenſe that he hath of the cauſe and miſery of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. When a poor man comes firſt into the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:45432:106"/> Priſon, he is ſenſible of the ſmell of the Priſon, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he is not ſenſible of his ſenſe, but he hath a ſenſe ſtill: So now it may be, you have been ſo uſed to be ſenſible of the Reproach of the Solemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; that it may be you are not ſenſible of your ſenſe.</p>
               <p>But I pray tell me, If that you have born the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Solemn Aſſembly upon your hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in private? Have you not been ſenſible? If you have faſted and prayed in reference to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Solemn Aſſembly: Have you not been ſenſible? Our Saviour Chriſt expounds the one by the other. There came to Chriſt the Diſciples of <hi>John,</hi> ſaying: Why do we and the Phariſees faſt oft, but thy Diſciples <hi>faſt</hi> not? Jeſus ſaid unto them: Can the Children of the Bride-chamber <hi>mourn, &amp;c?</hi> he expounds faſting by mourning: and if you have been more afflicted with the Reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly, than of any other thing, and have walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heavily under the burthen of it: Certainly you have been ſenſible.</p>
               <p>But whereas you ſay, This Promiſe doth run conditionally, and this Condition you have not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: Give me leave to ſay to you; Do you right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand a Condition? A Condition properly is that upon the account whereof a thing is done, and without which thing it cannot be done.</p>
               <p>As for example, I ſell my Commodity for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, now upon the account you pay ſo much Mony, I give you the commodity, and without that I do not give it: Now I pray, will you ſay, that <hi>your own ſenſe</hi> at the higheſt, is that upon the account whereof God will ſhew mercy? or will you ſay that God will not ſhew mercy unleſs you have <hi>ſenſe?</hi> We find that God doth return unto his people firſt, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:45432:106"/> afterwards he ſaith, <hi>then</hi> ſhall ye be aſhamed, and <hi>then</hi> ſhall ye loath your ſelves: 'tis very true, that he will ſhew mercy to thoſe that have <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſembly. But where doth he ſay that he will ſhew no mercy to thoſe that have no ſenſe? No where; For his love and grace is free: But if any man be ſenſible of the Reproach of the Solemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly lo this comfort is laid up for you: Are you ſcattered? the Lord will gather you: have you halted in this day of the Reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly? God will heal your halting: Have you ſuffered Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach? In the very place where you have ſuffered Reproach, God will give you a Name, and Fame, and Glory. I muſt ſay it, lift up your heads O ye Saints, you that hang down and are ſenſible of the Reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>You will ſay now: But what ſhould we do that we may be more ſenſible then of the Reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly? 'Tis clear, the Solemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly doth lie under Reproach, and God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed all this comfort to thoſe that are ſenſible of it: I hope I have ſome ſenſe, What ſhall I do that I may be more ſenſible of the Reproach of the Solemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, that this comfort, and this promiſe may come upon my ſoul?</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, get ſpiritual life, you muſt be liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; A dead man is not ſenſible: A living man is ſenſible of the ſcratch of a Pin, a dead man is not ſenſible of the gaſh of a Sword: 'Tis life that makes one ſenſible: Never think to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and to be dead: Therefore go to God for Spiritual life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then ſtrengthen your love unto God, and his Waies, and Children, and Ordinances; <hi>Dol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Then take advantage from all thoſe occaſions that you meet withal, to inlarge your mourning, and your ſenſe. When a man would leap far, he takes his riſe upon a Mole-hill, that he may leap the farther. Friends, you have many riſes this day, for your mourning, and for your ſenſe, improve all thoſe riſes, as you meet with any occaſion, look upon them as ſo many Mole-hills, look upon them as ſo many riſes for to go the farther in your ſenſe of the Reproach of the Solemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. then obſerve what thoſe evils are, thoſe ſins are, that have had a hand in bringing this Reproach upon the Solemn Aſſembly, and do not meddle therewithal: Take heed you do not add any of them to the heap. If a man have a burdenupon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he cannot ſtand under, and you go to lay any more upon him; (ſaith he) I pray take heed, I have as much on me, as my back will bear: And if there be company in a Boat, that the Boat be full, and another offer to come in; O no by no means, the Boat is ready to ſink already: Truely thus it is, the Boat is ready to ſink already it is ſo full. And do you look upon the Reproach of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſembly as your burthen; O then, take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice what it was that brought the Reproach, and take heed of that.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Take heed of the immoderate uſe of any
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:45432:107"/> creature comfort. Friends, let me ſay this to you; the more your hearts do ſoak into the comfort of the creatures, the leſs cauſe you will have of the Reproach of the Solemn Aſſemblies: The more your hearts ſoak into the comforts of your own houſe, the leſs ſenſible you will be of the Reproach of Gods Houſe: So that take heed of the immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate uſe of any creature comfort that is before you.</p>
               <p>To end all,</p>
               <p>Above all things ſtrengthen your Faith: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Senſe</hi> be an enemy to <hi>Faith,</hi> Faith is a friend to Senſe; eſpecially ſenſe of ſin, and ſenſe of the Churches miſeries. The more you look upon the fulneſs, and the freeneſs, and the certainty of the Promiſe of deliverance, the more your Faith will be ſtrengthned. Now this promiſe of deliverance here, is full, is free, 'tis large, it's repeated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and again; In the fourth of <hi>Micah</hi> you have the ſame promiſe, and its there repeated again and again.</p>
               <p>Why then ſhould you not ſay thus? Well through the grace of God, though I be ſenſible of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Solemn Aſſembly; yet I will believe for deliverance, and though I do believe for deliverance, yet I will be ſenſible through grace, of the Reproach of the Solemn Aſſembly. Do ſo; only let your Faith be the Mother unto this ſenſe; therefore take this Promiſe, read it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, work it, chafe it upon your hearts much when you are alone. I conclude reading it: Saith the Lord hare, <hi>I will gather them that are ſorrowful for the Solemn Aſſembly, who are of thee, to whom the Reproach of it was a burthen: Behold, at that time, I will undo all that afflict thee, and I will ſave her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out: And</hi>

               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>Heb. 3. 12.</bibl>
                  <q>Take heed Brethren, leaſt there be in any of you an evil heart of Unbelief, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the Living God.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN theſe words three things are the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
               <p>A great Diſeaſe that Chriſtians are ſubject to, to depart from God.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of that Diſeaſe, an evil heart of unbelief.</p>
               <p>The cure of that Diſeaſe, or the remedy againſt it; and that is, watchfulneſs, or taking heed. Take heed leaſt there be in any of you an evil heart of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, in departing from the living God.</p>
               <p>The Diſeaſe is great indeed, a diſeaſe common unto the Children of men to depart from God.</p>
               <p>And the Diſeaſe is very dangerous; for elſe, why ſhould we take heed thereof? I ſhall ſpeak ſomething to all theſe, and not ſo much as to ſingle out any Doctrine: But thus from the firſt.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:45432:109"/>
               <p> It is a very dangerous thing to depart from God.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>When may a man be ſaid to depart from God, or a people ſaid to depart from God: And what is the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For anſwer, There is a total departing from God, and a partial departing from God; every ſin that we do commit is a departing from God. For what is ſin, but an Avertency from the Creator, and a Convertency to the Creature?</p>
               <p>A total departure, there is, and that is two-fold, either total in regard of the object, or total in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſubject.</p>
               <p>A man doth totally depart from God <hi>Objective,</hi> when he doth depart from all the truths and wayes of God, and turns Heathen.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Subjective,</hi> a man doth totally depart from God, when he doth with his whole heart and ſoul depart from the Lord, though he may keep many truths; as a man that breaks in his outward eſtate, he may keep ſome thing, and yet be broken: So ſpiritually, a man may break and depart from God, and yet may keep many truths. Now it is this to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally departing that is here aimed at; and it is a dangerous thing, either totally or partially: But eſpecially a dangerous thing to depart from the Lord totally.</p>
               <p>Now that's the Queſtion: When may a man be ſaid to depart from God?</p>
               <p>Look when a man doth depart from the Service and the Worſhip of God, then he departs from God. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 11. <hi>But ye are they that forſake the Lord, that forget my holy mountain:</hi> When men do forget the Holy Mountain, the Worſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:45432:109"/> of God, and depart from that, then they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from, and forſake the Lord: And</p>
               <p n="2">2. Look when a man doth depart from an holy Converſation wherein he hath walkt before, then he is ſaid to depart from God, <hi>Job</hi> 6. 14. But he forſaketh the fear of the Almighty: <hi>To him that is afflicted, pity ſhould be ſhewed from his Friend, but he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh the fear of the Almighty:</hi> 'Tis not ſaid, <hi>he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes the Almighty,</hi> but he forſakes the <hi>fear</hi> of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, which is all one: When a man doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the fear of the Almighty; the good ways of God, a holy and a good Converſation wherein he hath walkt before, then he is ſaid to depart from God: And</p>
               <p n="3">3. Look when a man and in time of danger and trouble, not ſo much truſt unto the Lord, as unto an arm of fleſh for ſafety and deliverance, then he is ſaid to depart from God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 5. Thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>Curſed be the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arm, and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord:</hi> For a man in time of trouble to reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an arm of fleſh, and not upon the Lord himſelf. Why, this is to depart from God in Scripture Language.</p>
               <p>Now it is a dangerous thing ſo to do.</p>
               <p>For thereby a man doth depart from his life, in departing from <note place="margin">The danger of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from God.</note> God, he doth depart from his own life: For <hi>God is a Living God,</hi> ſaith the Text here: Take heed leaſt there be in any of you an evil heart of Unbelief, in depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the <hi>Living God:</hi> Departing from God, then a man doth depart from his life: <hi>Take away God and I am no body</hi> ſaith one: A true ſpeech, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Living God, and where's our life?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:45432:110"/> 2. Thereby alſo a man doth depart from his own Proſperity, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 5. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Uzziah, As long as he ſought the Lord, God made him to proſper:</hi> Departing then from the Lord, is a departing from a mans own proſperity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thereby alſo in departing from God, a man doth depart from his Refuge and ſhelter in the time of Adverſity: As he doth depart from his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, ſo by departing form God, A man doth depart from his ſhelter, and Covert, and Sanctuary in the time of adverſity. You know what God hath ſaid, <hi>I will be a little Sanctuary unto you:</hi> In the want of a Sanctuary, God will be a Sanctuary to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Fear not their fear, nor be affraid, ſanctifie the Lord of Hoſts himſelf, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread, and he ſhall be for a Sanctuary unto you:</hi> A hiding place, a ſhelter in the time of a ſtorm: When a man departs from God, then he departs from his Sanctuary, from his relief and ſhelter in the day of his adverſity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thereby alſo a man doth depart from his own Comfort, from all his Comforts: Take away the Sun, and 'tis not all the Torches in the Land can make a day, or can give day light: God is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mercy, and the God of all Conſolation; depart therefore from the Lord, and we depart from all our Conſolation, we depart from all our Comfort.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thereby alſo in departing from the Lord, a man doth depart from his own Being, and his own Mercy: Forſakes his own Mercies, and cleaves unto lying vanities. The name of God you know is I am, I am that I am: Who is All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient? I am ſaith God: Who is gracious? I am ſaith God. The name of God is, <hi>I am,</hi> the name of the Creature
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:45432:110"/> is, <hi>I am not:</hi> In departing therefore from the Lord, a man doth depart from his own being: In him we live, and move, and have our being, departing from the Lord, we depart from all: Surely 'tis a very dangerous thing then to depart from God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now in the ſecond place, The cauſe of this diſeaſe is Unbelief: Unbelief is the Root of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie, Infidelity is the ground of Apoſtaſie, an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving heart is the cauſe of this departing this God.</p>
               <p>Here are two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That an unbelieving heart, is an evil heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That unbelief is the cauſe and root of this Apoſtaſie, or departing from God.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt, I ſhall clear it by ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; and but name them.</p>
               <p>An unbelieving heart is an evil heart, for it is an hard heart; and therefore you have it in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>Leaſt any of you be hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin:</hi> What is an hard heart? we are generally miſtaken about an hard heart; we think ordinarily that when a mans heart is ſtraitned in duty, then his heart is hard: No, a man may be ſtraitned in duty, and yet his heart may be ſoft: But a th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng is ſaid to be hard when it dont yield: Soft when it doth yield. Touch hard wax and it yields not, touch ſoft wax and it yields, and takes the impreſſion: A ſoft heart yields unto Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; a hard heart yields not, but reſiſts and contradicts: So doth an unbelieving heart: An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing heart is a contradicting, reſiſting, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yielding heart; and therefore properly an unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heart is a hard heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As an unbelieving heart is an hard heart, ſo ſo an unblieving heart is an unclean heart: For faith
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:45432:111"/> purifies the heart, and therefore where the heart is unbelieving, the heart is unpurified, and ſo is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean: An unbelieving heart is an unclean heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As an unbelieving heart is an unclean heart, ſo it is a proud heart. You know what the Prophet <hi>Hab.</hi> ſaith, in his ſecond Chapter, <hi>Behold, his ſoul which is lifted up is not upright in him, but the juſt ſhall live by Faith:</hi> So then, an unbelieving heart alſo is a proud heart.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As an unbelieving heart is a proud heart, ſo it is a froward, peeviſh, fretful heart: <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>fretting</hi> are oppoſed, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>Fret not thy ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of evil doers, truſt in the Lord, and do good: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thy way unto him, and truſt in him,</hi> verſe 5. <hi>Reſt in the Lord, and wait patiently for him, fret not thy ſelf becauſe of him who proſpereth in his way,</hi> ver. 7. <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>fretting</hi> are oppoſed. How did the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> murmur in the Wilderneſs? and why? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their unbelief? Froward, and fretful, and murmuring. An unbelieving heart is a <hi>fretting fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> heart.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As it is a fretting and froward heart, ſo an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing heart is a raſh fooliſh heart, and will put one upon doing fooliſh things. It's raſh, faith makes not haſte, but unbelief makes haſte, <hi>I ſaid in my haſte I am c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt out of thy ſight:</hi> That's unbelief, I ſaid in my haſte, all men are Lyars, that's unbelief: What a fooliſh thing it was for <hi>David</hi> to ſcrabble on the door, and let fall his ſpittle, and fain himſelf mad? It was his unbelief that did it: An unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving heart, is a raſh, ſuddain, and a fooliſh heart.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As it is a raſh and a fooliſh heart, ſo it is a
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:45432:111"/> doubting, wavering, ſtaggering heart: It's ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he ſtaggered not through unbelief: It ſeems then, that as Drunkenneſs will make a man ſtagger and reel too and fro, ſo unbelief will make a man ſtagger and reel too and fro: A doubting, wavering, unſettel'd, ſtaggering heart, is an unbelieving heart.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As it is a doubting, ſtaggering heart, ſo it is an undutiful, and an unſerviceable heart: For it is <hi>Faith</hi> that is the great performer of Duties. What is duty, but faith Incarnate? what are <hi>works,</hi> but faith Incarnate? Faith is a friend to prayer, and prayer is a friend to faith. You may ſee how they are twiſted together, and one walks by another. In the third Pſalm, <hi>David</hi> being in very great diſtreſs, he believes, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>But thou O Lord art a ſhield for me, my glory, and the lifter up of mine head:</hi> Why then he prays, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>I cryed unto the Lord with my voice:</hi> Then he believes, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>I laid me down and ſlept,</hi> ver. 6. <hi>I will not be afraid of ten thouſands of people that have ſet themſelves againſt me round about:</hi> Then he prayes at the 7 <hi>ver. Ariſe O Lord, ſave me O my God:</hi> He prayes, and he believes, and he believes, &amp; he prays. Prayer is a friend to ſaith, and faith is a friend to prayer: But an unbelieving heart, is an undutiful heart, an unſerviceable heart, it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praying heart.</p>
               <p n="8">8. As an unbelieving heart is an undutiful heart, and an u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſerviceable heart: So it is a ſad, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged heart. <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul? and why art thou ſo diſquieted within me? Hope, wait, truſt</hi> in the Lord; And that's the way to take off diſcouragements: But a heart full of unbelief, is a heart full of diſcouragement.</p>
               <p n="9">9. As it is a ſad and diſconſolate heart, ſo an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:45432:112"/> heart is a diſhonouring heart: By Faith we honour the power of God, the grace of God, the All-ſufficiency of God: <hi>He that believeth not, makes God a Lyar,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, That God is not faithful: Faith honours the faithfulneſs of God, but he that believeth not makes God a Lyar: 'Tis a God diſhonouring ſin.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And to ſay no more in it but this: As it is a God diſhonouring ſin, ſo an unbelieving heart is the heart that God will puniſh with the moſt ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: We may ſee how the Lord puniſht it in his own people, when they were in the Wilderneſs, and they ſinned through unbelief, God kept them out of the Land of Promiſe; and why? <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>So we ſee that they could not enter in, becauſe of unbelief:</hi> This was in their firſt time; but now in their laſt time, they were broken off. And how came they to be broken off in Chriſt's time, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. <hi>Well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of unbelief they were broken off, and thou ſtandeſt by faith:</hi> Becauſe of unbelief they were kept out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> becauſe of unbelief they were broken off in Chriſt's time: So that an unbelieving heart, and an unbelieving ſoul, is ſuch an heart, and ſuch a ſoul, as God will puniſh with the moſt ſeverity; <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already:</hi> An unbelieving heart is an evil heart.</p>
               <p>But now in the ſecond place, This unbelieving heart or infidelity, is the ground of Apoſtaſie, for thereby we depart from God: Infidelity is the root of Apoſtaſie; for as by faith we are united to God, do draw near to God, and are united to him: So by our unbelief we depart from God. Faith (you know) is the uniting grace; and ſo on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by unbelief we depart from God: But this will appear if you conſider what thoſe things are
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:45432:112"/> that make men depart from God.</p>
               <p>They are the good things, and the evil things of this life.</p>
               <p>The good things of this life do flatter men from God.</p>
               <p>The evil things of this life, ſcare men from God. Now Faith will preſerve from both.</p>
               <p>If a man be tempted with the good things of this life: Yet if he have Faith, he will not depart from God, for by Faith we live upon God in the uſe of the good things.</p>
               <p>And if a man be tempted to depart from God by the evil things of this life, yet if he have but Faith, he will not depart from God; for by Faith we live upon God, and live above loſſes, and above croſſes; ſo that Faith doth preſerve us from both: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unbelief is the root and ground of all our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie, or declining from God: And we know how it was with the three Children, what it was that kept them in that evil day; there was the Muſick on the one hand, and the fiery Furnace on the other; but between both, they were kept and preſerved, for they believed: It was their Faith kept them from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting.</p>
               <p>But further, If that Unbelief be a Mother Sin, a Parent Sin, a breeding Sin, the root and cauſe of other ſins: Why then Unbelief muſt needs be the root, and ground, and cauſe of Apoſtacy. Why now, what is the cauſe of all our ſins but our unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief? People do not think ſo: What's the reaſon that men are ſo covetous and worldly, but becauſe of their unbelief? What's the reaſon when people are in trouble that they uſe indirect means to get out of trouble, but becauſe of their unbelief? What's the Reaſon that a Servant or a Child will tell lies?
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:45432:113"/> Becauſe of Unbelief. Unbelief is the Mother ſin, the Parent ſin, the Breeding ſin; and therefore Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief is the cauſe of departing and going off from God.</p>
               <p>And if ſo, why ſhould we not all then take heed of an evil heart of unbelief? That's the Remedy that is here preſcribed for the cure of this diſeaſe: Take heed Brethren, take heed leaſt there be in any of you an evil heart of Unbelief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take heed:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What ſhould we take heed of?</p>
               <p>Take heed of departing from God, and take heed of unbelief, and of an evil heart of unbelief, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we depart from God.</p>
               <p>Take heed of departing from God; For as we have heard already, it is a very dangerous thing to depart from God. Let me add this:</p>
               <p>If we depart from God, who will receive us? If a Proclamation be out againſt a man as a Traitor, who durſt receive him? And if a man do depart from the Lord, what creature dare receive him? In 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> ſpeaking of ſome that departed from the Lord; Whoſoever tranſgreſſeth, and abideth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt; if there come any into you, and bring not this Doctrine, receive him not into your houſe, neither bid him God ſpeed: The Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation is out againſt him, take heed how you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; Here's a command ſent from the Lord to take heed how you receive ſuch an one; I ſay, if we depart from God, who will receive us?</p>
               <p>And if you depart from God, you will hardly ever return unto him again: you know the place, it is impoſſible we ſhould be renewed by Repentance; Faith is <hi>but once</hi> delivered to the Saints: If the leaves be off in the Winter, the tree will grow again; but
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:45432:113"/> if it be pluck't up by the roots, it will grow no more: <hi>Twice dead</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: dead by the Law; but if a man depart from God under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, he is twice dead: now a man that's twice dead, certainly he will never recover; twice dead, How twice dead? Not that a man was twice alive. A man is hanged, and ſo is dead; after he is hanged he is quartered, here's a ſecond death; he is twice dead, not that he had a life between theſe two deaths, between his hanging and his quartering, but he is twice dead: So a man that departs from God under the Goſpel, he is twice dead: He was alive once in the ſtate of Innocency, but he loſt it, and now he is dead by the Goſpel, and out aſunder by the Goſpel, he is twice dead, and will hardly ever return to God again: A man that lives under the Goſpel, and departs from God, a thouſand to one, if ever he return to God again.</p>
               <p>And if we do depart from God, God will depart from us: God is with us while we are with him, but if we forſake the Lord, he will forſake us; if we depart from God, God will depart from us: God comes firſt to us, but we go firſt from him; God doth not leave any, but thoſe that leave him firſt; He comes to us before we come to him, but if we depart from him, he will depart from us: and if God go, the Devil comes; the Lord rejected <hi>Saul,</hi> and an evil Spirit came preſently upon him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who would not take heed of departing from God? But</p>
               <p>Secondly, As we are to take heed of departing from God, ſo we are to take heed of Unbelief, and of an unbelieving heart, whereby we depart from God; for the ſin of unbelief, and an unbelieving heart is very cunning and makes a deceitful heart:
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:45432:114"/> Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle in the words following: <hi>leaſt ye be hardned, through the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi> It hath very many pretences and fair colours. When they were invited by the Goſpel, what excuſes had they, all from unbelief? I have married a Wife, and I cannot come; and I have bought a piece of ground, and I muſt needs go ſee it, I pray thee, have me excuſed; And I have bought five yoke of Oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray thee have me excuſed. No, no, I have unbelief in my heart, and I cannot come; Unbelief made all theſe Excuſes, 'tis cunning heart, a deceiving ſin, the ſin of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</p>
               <p>And indeed it is ſuch a ſin, as hardens inſenſibly, that we cannot perceive: You can ſee the tree, the body of the tree, and the bark of the tree, and the boughs of the tree, and the leaves of the tree, but you cannot ſee the root of the tree. <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief</hi> is a root ſin, and that's leaſt perceived: Now when one hath to deal with a deceitful enemy, that is leaſt perceived, had be not need take heed? Take heed of departing from God, through an evil heart of unbelief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> The queſtion then is, What ſhall we do? Theſe are declining and departing times, wherein many do and will depart from God, (make account on't) what ſhall we do that we may not depart from God through unbelief? What ſhall we do, that we may take heed of an unbelieving heart, that we may take heed of departing from God? (I put them together into one queſtion) Now I ſhall give ſeveral directions here, and ſo wind up.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you would not depart from God through unbelief, in declining and departing times, be ſure that you keep cloſe unto the word of God, unto his
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:45432:114"/> appointments; and take heed how you meddle with any appointments that are like to his: For the more you depart from the word, the more you depart from God; and the more you meddle with appointments that are like to Gods, the more you depart from the word. Look into <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. and ſee what a Commandment there is, not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with any thing that's like to Gods appointments, at the 23 <hi>ver.</hi> There's direction concerning the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ointment, <hi>Take thou alſo unto thee principal ſpices, of pure myrrh five hundred ſhekels, and of ſweet Cinamon half ſo much, even two hundred and fifty ſhekels, and of ſweet Calamus two hundred and fifty ſhekels, and of Caſſia five hundred ſhekels, after the ſhekel of the Sanctuary, and of Oil Olive an hin:</hi> Then at the 25 <hi>ver. Thou ſhalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the art of the Apothecary: it ſhall be an holy anointing oil:</hi> Well at the 33 <hi>ver. Whoſoever compoundeth any like it, or whoſoever putteth any of it upon a ſtranger, ſhall even be cut off from his people:</hi> You ſhall make none like it.

Whoſoever ſhall make like unto that, to ſmell thereto, ſhall even be cut off from his people:</hi> A dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing it is to meddle with the appointments in the Worſhip and Service of God, that are like to Gods appointments: for any man (like an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary and a Confectioner) in the Worſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God; To make appointments in Gods
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:45432:115"/> Worſhip like unto the appointments of God; it's a dangerous thing, he ſhall be cut off from his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Therefore if you would not depart from God through unbelief, keep cloſe to the word, and the appointments thereof; and take heed of meddle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with any appointments that are like there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you would not depart from God through unbelief, take heed that you do not ſuffer any thing to come between your heart and Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Promiſe: We all fell in <hi>Adam</hi> through unbelief: How came that about? Why, the Devil got between <hi>Adams</hi> heart and the Commandment: <hi>Adam</hi> did not keep the Commandment cloſe, there was ſomething (a Devils promiſe) that got between his heart and Gods Commandment; and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from God. Take heed therefore, and be ſure that nothing come between your heart and Gods Commandment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you would not depart from God, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God through unbelief: Take heed of ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon any ſin becauſe it's ſmall, yielding to any Errour becauſe 'tis little, leaving any truth becauſe it is but little or ſmall. There are ſome paſſage truths (as I may call them) in time of War when one Army is againſt another, you ſhall ſee how earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they will contend for a little paſſage, a little ſpot of ground; ask them the reaſon, O that's a paſſage: So there are ſome truths that are but ſmall in themſelves, and they are paſſage truths: and if you would not depart from God, and the great truths; look to paſſage truths, look to keep your paſſages.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you would not depart from God, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:45432:115"/> God through unbelief, Be ſure that you lay all your work in ſincerity; for the ground that had not Root in it ſelf, falls away. Take this for a certain Rule. <hi>He that begins in Hypocriſie, will end in Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> Here are ſome it may be (though but few of us) that are beginning, and laying the foundation: Look to your foundation, that it be laid well in ſincerity; for if your foundation be laid in hypocriſie, you will end in Apoſtacy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If you would not depart from the Lord through an unbelieving heart, take heed of ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with God, want of Communion in private: Enmity begins in ſtrangeneſs among men; Firſt, people grow ſtrange, and then they come to hate one another, and to be enemies to one another: Enmity begins with ſtrangeneſs, and truly ſo it is with God; Firſt ſtrangeneſs, and then Enemies: If you would not depart from God, the Living God; O take heed of ſtrangeneſs with God, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your private Communion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Take heed of taking offence, and of being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at any of the good wayes of God, or any of the people of God: 'Twas Dr. <hi>Preſtons</hi> uſual ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I never knew any one decline, or fall away; But firſt he took offence at ſome good man, and then he took offence at more good men, and then he took offence at the wayes of God themſelves: And you know it's ſaid of the Diſciples, they were offended and went back: And of the falſe ground, <hi>By and by he is offended;</hi> he doth not ſay, <hi>By and by they fall away:</hi> Why? Becauſe uſually falling away and departing begins at being offended: Therefore would you not depart from the Living God, then take heed you take no offence at the good wayes of God, or the people of God.</p>

                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:45432:116"/> 7. Take heed of walking alone: For you ſee what follows in the Text, ſaith he, Take heed Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, leaſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God, <hi>But exhort one another daily:</hi> So that the onely way to be kept from departing from the Living God, is to be exhorting one another. <hi>Then they that feared the Lord ſpake often one to another:</hi> In evil days exhort one another daily, in declining times take heed of walking alone.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Take heed of Remiſſeneſs in duty: Remiſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in duty, will cauſe omiſſion of duty; omiſſion of duty, will cauſe Commiſſion of evil; and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of evil will cauſe a departing from God: I uſe to ſay, the ſlumber of grace, is a preparation to ſin; and thoſe that ſlumber in times of injoyments, they will fall in ſuffering times (it's likely) you know how it was with the Diſciples that ſlumbred and ſlept at the Mount of Transfiguration, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they ſlept alſo in ſuffering time: Well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if you would not depart from God, the Living God through unbelief; Take heed of the ſlumbers of grace, take heed of remiſneſs in any duty, leaſt remiſneſs cauſe omiſſion, omiſſion commiſſion, and commiſſion departing from God.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Take heed that you do not ſtand poring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Temptations, whatſoever your Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be: When the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſtung by the Serpents in the Wilderneſs, they did not ſtand poring upon the Arm that was ſtung, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, O my Arm, O how it is ſwell'd! but they lookt up upon the Brazen Serpent: If they had lookt upon their Arm, and ſtood poring upon that, they had never been Cur'd: So now, if in caſe we be tempted, the way is, not to ſtand poring upon
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:45432:116"/> the temptation, but to look off unto Chriſt: If therefore you would not depart from God in the time of Temptation, take heed of poring upon the Temptation, look off from that upon the brazen Serpent. And</p>
               <p n="10">10. Set the Lord alwaies before your eyes, his All-ſufficiency, his Fulneſs, his Grace, his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: I have ſet the Lord alwaies before me, at my right-hand (ſaith <hi>David)</hi> and therefore I ſhall not fall: So do you.</p>

               <p n="12">12. Take heed how you conſult with Fleſh and Blood in the things of God. If <hi>Paul</hi> had conſulted with Fleſh and Blood, he had never believed: And if in the things of God we conſult with Fleſh and Blood, we are ſure to depart from God, the living God.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Put your ſelves often unto this diſjunction. Come O my ſoul, either there is enough in God alone, or there is not: If there be not enough in God alone, how do they live in Heaven?

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:45432:117"/> there is enough in God: Well, if there be enough in God alone, O my Soul, Why ſhould I depart from God? All departure doth ſignifie an inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency. I leave this houſe, and go to another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this houſe is not ſufficient. When I am ſick I ſend to my neighbour for Beer, why? becauſe my Beer don't like me. The Bee leaves one flower, and goes to another, becauſe it doth not find enough in that flower: all departing notes an inſufficiency. If I depart from God, it notes an inſufficiency in God: Is it not becauſe there is no God in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ye are gone down to <hi>Baal-zephon?</hi> Well, either there is enough in God alone, O my ſoul, or there is not: If there be not enough in God alone, then how do they live in Heaven? If there be enough in God alone, then why ſhould I depart from God through unbelief? Thus put your ſelves upon this Dilemma, and it will be a means to keep you from departing from God through your unbelief.</p>
               <p n="14">14. If you would not depart from God, the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God through unbelief, Then take heed of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: Take heed of covetouſneſs, and of worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: We cannot ſerve two Maſters, God, and Mammon, you muſt cleave to the one, and forſake the other: <hi>Demas</hi> hath forſaken me, and imbrac'd this preſent world. A worldly covetous heart will depart from God, and therefore take heed of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, worldlineſs: Seek not great things for your ſelves: Seek ye great things in theſe times? Seek them not; 'Tis a great matter to have ones life for a prey in evil times.</p>
               <p n="15">15. If you would not depart from God, the living God through unbelief, then take heed of miſ-belief; all unbelief is grounded upon a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief: We don't believe becauſe we miſ-believe;
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:45432:117"/> we ſee it in <hi>Adam,</hi> he was guilty of unbelief, how? Why he believed the Devil, <hi>You ſhall be like God,</hi> ſaith he, and by his miſ-believing he came into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; His unbelief was grounded upon a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. God draws by Promiſes, and the Devil tempts by Promiſes. Why when the Devil tempts by Promiſes, if we believe his Promiſes, we ſhall ſoon be guilty of unbelief, in regard of Gods Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and therefore if we would not depart from God, the living God, through unbelief, take heed of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing.</p>
               <p n="16">16. If you would not depart from God through unbelief, then look to your Judgement in reference to your Converſation, and look to your Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in reference to your Judgment: Look to your Life in reference to your Opinion, look to your O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in reference to your Life. Faith and a good Opinion, doth preſerve a good Life, and a good Life doth preſerve Faith and a good Opinion: Faith lys in the boſom of a good Converſation; Faith is beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by a good Converſation, and a good Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is beſt preſerved by Faith: Sometime men do depart from God, and their departure begins above in the Judgment, and like Rheum it falls down upon the Lungs, it falls down upon the Converſation; Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the departing begins below in the Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſteams up into the Judgement: as ſome things that are unſavoury in the ſtomach, they ſteam up into the head.

               <p n="17">17. If you would not depart from God, the living God, through unbelief, Then take heed how you run with the times: Good friends, there is the truth of the times, and there is the error of the times: There is the grace of the times, and there is the ſin of the times, ſeldom that the generality of people hit it, they ſeldom hit the truth of the times, ſeldom hit the grace of the times; I ſay, the generality of people ſeldom hit it, they are like the dead Fiſh that ſwims down the water, the living Fiſh ſwims againſt the Tide; and ſo the living Chriſtian ſwims againſt the tide of the Times: Take heed, if you would not depart from the living God through unbelief; take heed how you fall with the times; for I ſay, ſeldom do the generality of people hit the truth, or the grace of the times.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Know that it is the greateſt honour (poſſeſs your ſouls on't) that may be, to wait upon the Lord, and the greateſt diſhonour to depart from God through unbelief; Thereby a man proclaims his own folly; thereby he doth put himſelf out of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; thereby he caſts dirt and reproach in the very face of God: Is it not becauſe there is no God in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ye go down to <hi>Baal-zebub</hi> the God of <hi>Ekron?</hi> God will caſt dirt and reproach in their faces, that caſt dirt and reproach in his face: 'Tis the greateſt honour to wait upon the Lord; 'Tis the greateſt diſhonour to depart from God.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Be very ſenſible of your own unbelieving heart, and of all your former departings from God: The beſt way to keep from new ſins, is to be very ſenſible of old ſins; he that is very ſenſible of his former ſins, ſhall through the grace of God be kept

But our ſtrength is to commit our ſelves unto God, <hi>Commit thy way unto the Lord,</hi> ſaith he; and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in evil times, ſuffering times, calls upon us to do this, to commit our ſelves into the hand of God, as into the hands of a faithful Creator: Are the times declining; and do many depart from the Lord? take heed, be not to confident, he that ſtandeth, ſtandeth by Faith; be not to confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of your own ſtanding, but commit your way, your ſouls, and your all unto God.

               <p>IN this Chapter our Lord and Saviour Chriſt tells us, how it ſhall be in the latter day, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before his ſecond, or his laſt coming: which he declares by two Similitudes or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons.</p>
               <p>The firſt compariſon is drawn from the days of <hi>Noah:</hi> wherein he obſerves their <hi>ſecurity,</hi> and their puniſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Security:</hi> As it was in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo ſhall it be alſo in the days of the ſon of man. They did eat, they drank, they marryed Wives, they were given in Marriage, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. 27.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Puniſhment:</hi> And the ſloud came and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them all.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Compariſon is drawn from the days and times of <hi>Lot,</hi> where you have their Security, and their Puniſhment, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. Likewiſe alſo, as it was in the days of <hi>Lot:</hi> They did eat, they drank, they bought, they ſold, they planted, they builded.</p>
               <p>The puniſhment, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. But the ſame day that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:45432:119"/> 
                  <hi>Lot</hi> went out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> it Rained fire and brimſtone from heaven, and deſtroyed them all.</p>
               <p>The Rendition at the 30 <hi>ver.</hi> Even thus ſhall it be in the day when the ſon of man is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Whereupon he dehorts them from the world, and the care thereof, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. In that day, he which ſhall be upon the houſe top, and his ſtuff in the houſe, let him not come down to take it away; and he that is in the field, let him likewiſe not return back.</p>
               <p>Which he preſſeth by divers Arguments.</p>
               <p>The firſt is drawn from the example of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, who for her looking back, was turned into a Pillar of Salt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Argument is drawn from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary good, <hi>Whoſoever</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall loſe his life, ſhall preſerve it,</hi> v. 33.</p>
               <p>The third is drawn from the ſeparation that Chriſt hath made between the neareſt Intereſt and Relations at that day, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. <hi>In that night there ſhall be two men in one bed, the one ſhall be taken, and the other left; two women ſhall be grinding together, the one ſhall be taken and the other left; two men ſhall be in the field, the one ſhall be taken and the other left.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am now to deal with this firſt Argument, drawn from the example of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, who for her look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back to a worldly intereſt, was turned into a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Salt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remember Lot</hi>'s <hi>Wife,</hi> and remember her at ſuch a time, and remember her upon ſuch an account: Chriſt would have us remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife.</p>
               <p>There is a ſpecial time when <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife is to be remembred by us.</p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:45432:120"/>
               <p> We are not only to read the Story of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, we may forget that; but we are frequently to conſider, and call it unto mind: A time there is and a ſpecial time, when <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife is to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by us?</p>
               <p>For the clearing and proſecuting hereof:</p>
               <p>Firſt, We will inquire, <hi>what</hi> of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife is to be remembred by us?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Why Lot's</hi> Wife is to be remembred by us?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>How Lot</hi>'s Wife is to be remembred us?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, What is the ſpecial time wherein <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife is to be remembred by us? And</p>
               <p>Fifthly, How we ſhould ſo remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, as we may gain thereby?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, And what we ſhould do, that we may ſo profitably remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife?</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for the firſt, If it be ſaid, what of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife is to be remembred by us.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, her Sin, and her Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>She was turned into a Pillar of Salt, ſhe was ſtricken with a ſore Judgment: A mortal deadly ſtroke: ſhe was not ſtricken as <hi>Miriam,</hi> with a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie; but with a mortal deadly ſtroke, ſhe was ſtricken with Death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As ſhe was ſtricken with a mortal deadly ſtroke, ſo with a ſuddain ſtroke: She had no time given her to repent. It is a great mercy to die ſtanding, to die exerciſing of grace: but to be ſtricken with death in the very height of ones ſin, in the very act of ones ſin, and to have no time given one to repent: This is a great judgment, and this befell her.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As it was a ſuddain ſtroke, ſo it was an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:45432:120"/> ſtroke: From the hand of God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. Immediate mercies are the ſweeteſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and immediate judgments are the ſowereſt judgments. Thus ſhe was ſtricken by the hand of God immediately.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As ſhe was ſtricken with an immediate ſtroke, an immediate hand of God: So this ſtroke, it was an exemplary ſtroke: for by it ſhe was hanged up in chains as it were, and Gibbited for all ages to take heed of: To take heed of looking back, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, and backſliding.</p>
               <p>And ſhe was ſtricken into a Pillar of Salt.</p>
               <p>And if you ask, why into a Pillar of Salt?</p>
               <p>Why Salt? ſaith one, that by her example ſhe might ſeaſon others; that by her example all of us might be warned to take heed of looking back to any worldly intereſt.</p>
               <p>But I think alſo by her looking back, ſhe in ſome meaſure complyed, and comported with the men of <hi>Sodom,</hi> as they were ſmitten with brimſtone, fire, and Salt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 23. And the whole Land thereof became Brimſtone and Salt: So ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with them, and returning in her heart and affections to them, partaking with them in their ſin, doth partake with them alſo in their judgment, and ſo was turned into Salt.</p>
               <p>And into a <hi>Pillar</hi> of Salt, that's durable, and of continuance: As the everlaſting Covenant is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Pillar of Salt, ſo her body (for I ſpeak not of her ſoul, neither doth the Scripture ſpeak any thing concerning that) being turned into a material Pillar of Salt for the longer continuance, that ſhe might be an everlaſting Monument and warning to all Generations to take heed of looking back, decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and backſliding: And thus ſhe was turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:45432:121"/> a Pillar of Salt: That's her Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>As for her ſin that did bring her into this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was exceeding great and hainous, for there was much diſobedience in it, being directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto the expreſs Commandement of God by the Angel. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. <hi>The Angels</hi> ſaid when they had brought them forth abroad, <hi>Eſcape for thy life, look not behind thee, neither ſtay thou in all the Plain; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape to the Mountain leſt thou be conſumed.</hi> Here was an expreſs Commandment that they ſhould not look back. It ſeemed to be no great matter for <hi>Adam</hi> to eat an Apple, a forbidden Apple; but being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to Gods expreſs Commandement, there was much diſobedience in it: And ſo though it ſeem'd no great matter to look back, yet being directly contrary to Gods expreſs Commandement There was much diſobedience in it.</p>
               <p>Again, There might be much incredulity and unbelief in this thing, for ſhe might doubt whether God would fulfil his word in deſtroying <hi>Sodom</hi> (as God had ſaid) and ſo might look back to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Word of the Lord were fulfilled, or no.</p>
               <p>But beſides, There might be, and there was a great deal of carnal affection in looking back unto a worldly intereſt there, upon which account our Saviour Chriſt brings it in, in this chapter, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions men upon that.</p>
               <p>Yea there was in effect an Apoſtacy, a Typical Apoſtacy, upon which account our Saviour Chriſt ſpeaks on't, and ſaith he, he that puts his hand to the Plow, and looks back: an Apoſtacy there was in it. Now this Apoſtacy of hers was aggravated by many circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by the goodneſs of her Relation: The more gracious a mans Relations are, if he do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:45432:121"/> the greater is his ſin, if he do decline: Now ſhe was the Wife of a gracious holy man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for her to decline from ſuch a Relation, it was exceeding wicked.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And beſides, As ſhe did look back under ſuch a Relation, ſo ſhe was not tempted thereunto: The leſs temptation to any ſin, the greater the ſin: Thoſe that are tempted to ſin, excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; The woman thou gaveſt me, ſhe gave me to eat: But now <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife could not ſay thus; I was tempted by <hi>Lot,</hi> or by any other; No, ſhe was not over-born by any temptation from without, and therefore her ſin was the greater.</p>
               <p n="3">3. She ſinned in good company: 'Tis an evil thing to ſin in any company; but the better the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is that I ſin in, the worſe is my ſin: She had the company of her husband; ſhe had the conduct of Angels: now upon this ground ſhe ſinned.</p>
               <p n="4">4. She ſinned in the face of Juſtice: 'Tis an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil thing for a Thief to ſin at any time, but to cut a mans purſe before the Judge, while he is upon the Bench doing Juſtice, this is worſe. God was now doing Juſtice upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> and for <hi>Lot's</hi> Wife to ſin in the face of Juſtice doing, it made her ſin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And yet farther, To ſay no more in it, But that ſhe ſinned alſo in the face of great deliverance; God had now brought her out, Husband, Children, and ſelf, and delivered them with an high hand: To ſin in the face of a deliverance wrought with an high hand, is to ſin with an high hand: Such was her deliverance, wrought with an high hand, and therefore for her to ſin thus, was exceeding evil, and very ſinful. And thus you ſee what that is of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:45432:122"/> 
                  <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife that is to be remembred by us, namely, her ſin and her puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But then Secondly, Why is <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife to be remembred by us.</p>
               <p>She is to be remembred by us, becauſe that ſhe is Recorded, and her Example is recorded for that end and purpoſe: She is hung up, and Gibbeted (as it were) for all that go by and read the Scripture to Remember.</p>
               <p>Again, If that whatſoever is written in the Old Teſtament, is written for our inſtruction for our admonition, and Judgements there recorded for our Caution and Warning: Then good Reaſon that ſhe and her Example ſhould be remembred, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. <hi>For whatſoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning,</hi> and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. ſpeaking of the ſins of the <hi>Iſraelites, With many of them God was not well pleaſed, for they were overthrown in the Wilderneſs. Now theſe things were our Examples, to the intent we ſhould not luſt after evil things, as they alſo luſted. Neither be ye Idolaters as were ſome of them, as it is written, the people ſate down to eat and drink, and roſe up to play: Neither let us commit Fornication as ſome of them committed, and fell in one day, three and twenty thouſand: Neither let us tempt Chriſt, as ſome of them alſo tempted, and were deſtroyed of Serpents: Neither murmur ye, as ſome of them alſo murmured, and were deſtroyed of the Deſtroyer. Now</hi> at the 11th. <hi>verſe, All theſe things hap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed unto them, for our enſamples, and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, We are to remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, and ſhe is to be remembred by us, that we fall not into the ſame condemnation: Read the Hiſtory, leaſt
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:45432:122"/>
                  <!-- ment of God, lea&s;t --> thou thy ſelf beeſt made the Judgement of God: The only way to be kept from afflictions our ſelves, is to gain by other mens affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: How ſhould we gain by ſuch afflictions as theſe, if we ſhould not remember them?</p>
               <p>Again, If you look into Scripture, you ſhall find, that of all the Judgments that are Recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there is none ſo frequently mentioned and repeated, as the Judgment of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> in the 19 <hi>Gen.</hi> once in the 20 <hi>Jer.</hi> again, and <hi>49th.</hi> again, the 11 of <hi>Hoſ.</hi> again, the 4 <hi>Amos</hi> again, the 17 <hi>Luke</hi> again, the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude</hi> again: So then look into Scripture, and you ſhall find there is no Judgment ſo often repeated as this Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah:</hi> And why? That it may be obſerved in all the circumſtances thereof.</p>
               <p>And to ſay no more in it but thus: There is a <hi>Sodom</hi> that is ſtill to be deſtroyed, in the 11 <hi>Rev.</hi> You find that <hi>Rome</hi> in the Latitude thereof is called <hi>Sodom:</hi> Their dead bodies ſhall lie in the ſtreet of the great City, which ſpiritually is called <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt:</hi> This <hi>Sodom</hi> is to be deſtroyed with fire, in the 18 <hi>Rev.</hi> She ſhall be utterly burnt with fire. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. And as <hi>Lot</hi> was commanded to come out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſo the people of God are commanded, <hi>Come out of her my people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife by looking back did partake with them in their ſin, and ſo partake in their Plagues: So ſaith the Lord, Come out of her my people, that you be not partaker of her ſin, and that ye receive not of her Plagues: So then, there is a <hi>Sodom</hi> ſtill which is to be deſtroyed, which we are to come out of; ſpiritual <hi>Sodom;</hi> and therefore even this of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife coming out is diligently to be conſidered, and to be remembred by us, that
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:45432:123"/> we may know how to come out well: And thus we ſee the Reaſons why <hi>Lot's</hi> Wife is to be remembred by us.</p>
               <p>But Thirdly, How is <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by us?</p>
               <p n="1">1. She is to be remembred by us in a way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, again and again to mind the ſtory and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife: You may oftentimes read the ſtory, and may have forgot the ſame, but as the clean beaſt was to chew the Cud, which in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> is a bringing of the Meat into the mouth again: So you may have oftentimes eaten up this ſtory of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, but you are to chew the Cud, and bring it into your Memory again, to remember it in a way of reflection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In a way of meditation, I remember all thy marvellous works, and meditate thereon ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid:</hi> Remembrance without meditation will do lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good, it muſt be remembrance with meditation: And</p>
               <p n="3">3. As it muſt be with Meditation, ſo with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fear, and Reverence, and Adoration. I have read of a Heathen, that when he came by the Gallows, he would alwayes put off his Hat and bow, and ſay, God ſave Juſtice: And ſo now, when we come by this Gibbit, we ſhould not come by, but bow with Fear, and Reverence, and Adoration, adoring the Juſtice and the Soveraignty of God in his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. We are to remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife in a way of Fear, and Reverence, and Adoration.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We are to remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife in a way of Caution, ſo as to take heed by her: Remember how ſhe looked back, and take heed that we do not look back: And thus we are to remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife.</p>
               <p>But then Fourthly, What and when is the ſpecial
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:45432:123"/> time that <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife is to be remembred by us?</p>
               <p>It is good to remember her frequently: But we are in a ſpecial manner to remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife in the time of declining, in declining times remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber her that you do not decline. Thus our Saviour Chriſt brings her in for to be remembred by us, that we do not look back, as ſhe looked back.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are to remember her in times of ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of great ſecurity: As in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, they were in great ſecurity: They ate, and drank, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as in the Dayes of <hi>Lot,</hi> they ate, and drank, they marryed, they were in great ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: Now ſaith our Saviour, <hi>So ſhall it be,</hi> but <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Lot</hi>'s <hi>Wife:</hi> So that in times of great ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife is to be remembred by us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. She is to be remembred by us alſo, In time when God doth call upon his people by his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ions to go out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and make no delay: For ſo our Saviour alſo preſſes it to you, <hi>Let not him that is on the houſe top go down, &amp;c.</hi> But <hi>remember</hi> Lot<hi>'s</hi> Wife, God would have no delay then: So when God calls upon a people to come out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> make no delay, but remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife: Thus we ſee what the time is.</p>
               <p>But fifthly and laſtly, What good ſhall we get by remembring <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife? Is there any good to be gotten by remembring <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife?</p>
               <p>Yes, much every way: Something in a way of Inſtruction, ſomething in a way of Caution.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By way of inſtruction: I ſhall lay before you ten or eleven inſtructions that we may gain hereby.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If this ſtory of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife be true, and do live in our Memory, then why ſhould not we ſtand and admire, and ſay, Lord, how unſearchable are
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:45432:124"/> thy J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

God in the midſt of Judgment doth remember mercy: In the midſt of Mercy he Remembers Judgment. In the midſt of Judgment upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> he remembred mercy for <hi>Lot,</hi> and for his Family: In the midſt of mercy upon <hi>Lot,</hi> and upon his Family, he remembred Judgment upon <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife. The ſame thing may be done by one in a way of Faith, and he may live, and done by another in a way of unbelief, and he may die. <hi>Abraham</hi> looked upon <hi>Sodom</hi> when <hi>Sodom</hi> was a burning, <hi>Abraham</hi> got up early in the morning, at the 27 <hi>ver.</hi> to the place where he ſtood before the Lord, and he looked toward <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and toward all the Land of the Plain, and beheld, and lo, the ſmoke of the Country went up, as the ſmoke of a Furnace: <hi>Abraham</hi> beheld, and looked upon it in a way of believing and lived: <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife looks back in a way of unbelief, and ſhe dies. The ſame thing may be done by one in a way of Faith, and live, and by another in a way of unbelief and die. But literally here, two ſhall be in one bed, the one ſhall be taken, and the other ſhall be left; two ſhall be in the field, the one ſhall be taken, and the other left: Two in a bed, <hi>Lot</hi> and his Wife, one taken, and the other left: Two in a field, they were going both out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the other left; Lord how unſearchable are thy Judgments, and thy wayes paſt finding out.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this ſtory of <hi>Lot's</hi> Wife be true, and do live in our Memory, then here we may learn by
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:45432:124"/> way of Inſtruction, and ſee how far a Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may go in Religion, and yet come ſhort at the laſt: <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife went far, ſhe was a profeſſor of the firſt and the higheſt form, ſhe had lived a long while in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, ſhe had walked with her Husband <hi>Lot,</hi> and injoyed his prayers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years; ſhe ſtood out againſt the wickedneſs of <hi>Sodom</hi> while ſhe was there; ſhe was in ſome me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. If this ſtory of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife be true, and do live in our memory; Then you may learn, and ſee by way of Inſtruction; That the beſt Relations will not ſecure from the hand of God if we continue evil: She was the neareſt Relation to a Holy Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, <hi>Lot,</hi> yet ſinned; Her Relation would not ſave her, and would not excuſe her: Why ſhould any ſay, I am the Child of ſuch a godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; I am the Servant of ſuch a godly Maſter; I am a member of ſuch a Church: 'Tis not the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and the beſt Relations will ſave us from the hand of God, if we ſin againſt him: Here was the neareſt Relation, and yet not exempted from the ſevereſt puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If this ſtory of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife be true, and do indeed live in our memory, Then here you may ſee what an evil thing it is to look back from that which God hath delivered us from. It is an evil thing to ſin againſt that Deliverance that hath a <hi>Such</hi> written on it: In the <hi>9th.</hi> of <hi>Ezra,</hi> ſee how he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, <hi>After all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great treſpaſſes; ſeeing th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But you ſee how it far'd with her. Well then you ſee, it's an evil thing to look back to that which God hath delivered us from.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If this ſtory of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife be true, and live in our memory; Here we may learn by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, That former Deliverance will not ſecure us from future Deſtruction: She was delivered with a great Deliverance, and yet deſtroyed with a great Deſtruction: The like is ſaid of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude: I will put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, How that the Lord having ſaved the people out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>afterward deſtroyed them that believed not:</hi> Delivered, and yet deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Former Deliverance will not ſecure us from future Deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If this ſtory of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife be true, and live in our memory, then here we may learn by way of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:45432:125"/> Inſtruction; 'Tis ill ſinning when God is puniſhing: It's good begging while God is giving; but O 'tis ill ſinning while God is puniſhing: If he be angry, yea but a little, bleſſed are all thoſe that truſt in him: Be wiſe now therefore O ye Kings; be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed ye Judges of the Earth, ſerve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling: Kiſs the Son, leſt he be angry, and ye periſh from the way. The way, What way? Why, in the way of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; When God is fetching his ſtroke at a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſtand out of the way then of Gods ſtroke: God was ſtriking at <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife came in the way of his ſtroke, and ſhe dyed for it; It's ill ſinning, when God is puniſhing.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If that this ſtory be true, and live in your memory, then here you may learn, That thoſe that are exemplary in ſinning, ſhall be exemplary in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing: She was the firſt that ſinned this kind of ſin, and the firſt that fell under ſuch a Judgement. The Lord mark'd <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> Jeroboam <hi>the Son of</hi> Nebat, <hi>that made</hi> Iſrael <hi>to ſin;</hi> Why he was the firſt, and God ſet a mark upon him. This is that wicked <hi>Ahaz,</hi> that in the time of his affliction ſinned yet more: What a mark did God ſet upon <hi>Judas,</hi> in his life, in his death? Why he was the firſt that made a treacherous retreat from the Goſpel; He was the head of thoſe Halbertiers that came to attatch Chriſt: So an Apoſtate, uſually doth head the perſecuting party, but God ſet a mark upon him. Thoſe that are firſt in ſin, and thoſe that are exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary in ſinning, God will make exemplary in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If this ſtory of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wiſe be true, and do live in our memory: Then here we may ſee what an evil thing it is to miſ-chuſe in our chuſing time.

                  <hi>Lot</hi>'s Family was a Religious Family. Never bear upon it that you are a Religious Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, It's poſſible that a Religious Family may have a black mark of Gods Indignation, and poſſibly the death of one Relation may be a ſnare to the other: We know the ſin that <hi>Lot</hi> committed afterwards with his Daughters. The death of this Relation, a ſnare to the other, and God doth know how to ſtrike at one through the ſides of another: God ſtrikes at <hi>Lot</hi> through the ſides of his Wife; God knows how to ſtrike at one through the ſides of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>

                  </gap>d the main of all is this: If the ſtory of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife be true, and do live in our memory, O what an evil thing is it to look back, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline in declining times? How quick was God with <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife for looking back? She never ſinned this ſin before, 'twas the firſt ſin that ever in this kind ſhe committed; and ſhe might have ſaid: Why Lord, It's the firſt time that ever I committed it, and indeed I was taken before I was aware thus to look back, I did not conſider well of What I did: But God turned her preſently into a Pillar of Salt: God was quick with her: Why? For to ſhew thus much, God will be quick with Apoſtates: God will turn the Turners; She turned to look back, and God turned her into a Pillar of Salt. And ſo for thoſe that turn, God will turn; God will turn Turners: God will be quick with Turners; God will turn Turners into a Pillar of Salt. God is quick with Apoſtates, and ſuch as do decline. And thus I have given you theſe eleven things by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>As many I might give you in a way of Caution, but the Inſtance only in one.</p>

               <p> If this ſtory of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife be true, and do live in our Remembrance; By way of Caution: Why ſhould we not all take heed how we look back to worldly Intereſts, in the day when the Son of man ſhall be Revealed, or in this day of the Goſpel, when the Son of man is Revealed? You ſee what became of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife for her looking back: and therefore why ſhould we not all of us take heed, how we look back or decline in this day that the Son of man is Revealed?</p>
               <p>You will ſay, what ſhall we do that we may not decline? What ſhall we do that we may ſo remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, that we may not decline or look back in declining times?</p>
               <p>I ſhall not ſpeak at large unto the Argument: Onely thus.</p>
               <p>If you would not look back in declining times, ſhut your eyes and your ears againſt all the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and threatnings of the World: For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil he tempts much now in theſe daies to falſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as he tempted our Saviour Chriſt, when he ſaid: <hi>All this will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me:</hi> That was falſe Worſhip: So now the Devil ſaith, All this living and preferment will I give thee, if thou wilt worſhip me ſo: This Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board with Plate will I give thee; this Chamber hung with Tapeſtry will I give thee, if thou wilt worſhip ſo; This great living and preferment will I give thee, if thou wilt worſhip ſo: If thou wilt not worſhip, all this will I take from thee: Would you therefore be kept, that you may never look back? Shut your eyes, and ſhut your ears, go blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold into Gods Commandements, as <hi>Abraham</hi> your Father did.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you would not look back in declining
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:45432:130"/> times: Take heed of leaving any Neſt-egg in the day of Reformation; if there be an Egg left in the Neſt, ſure enough the Hen will return to the Neſt to lay yet. So in the time of Reformation, If a Neſt-Egg be left, as God knows what Neſt-eggs were left among us: But I ſay, If in a time of publick Reformation Neſt-eggs be left, there will be a return of the Hen to the Neſt-egg there. Will you know what that good man ſaid, Mr. <hi>Dearing</hi> before Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> The houſe is ſwept, and the Dirt is behind the Door, there comes a Hen and ſcrapes it all out again: But I put it into this, If a Neſt-egg be left, be it a publick Reformation, or a private Reformation; yet if a Neſt-egg be left, there will be a returning back again.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you would not look back in declining times, Then be ſure that you never part friends with any ſin: Some will part with their ſin, but they will part friends with it. Saith one, By the grace of God I will never commit this ſin again, and I'le go but this time into this company, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this time I will never go to them again: and ſo they part friends with their ſin: Why, if a man be to part with his friend, he goes part of the way with him, and having parted friends, they look after one another; And ſo when a man parts friends with his ſin, he will certainly look back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: But if a man would never look back to his ſin in declining times, let him part as an enemy to it. He that will part friends with his ſin, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly return to his ſin again.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you would not look back in declining times, be ſure of this: That you do not run a ſhare, or a part in the Veſſel that God is about to deſtroy: Where my grief is, there is my finger; where my
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:45432:131"/> love is, there is my eye; If I have a ſhare and a part in the Veſſel that God is about to deſtroy, I ſhall look after the Veſſel, what becomes thereof. Why now <hi>Babylon</hi> that art to be deſtroyed, <hi>Babylon</hi> is not to repent; <hi>Babylon</hi> that art to be deſtroyed: <hi>Babylon</hi> is not to be reformed: Waſh dirt an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times, and you cannot make clean the dirt; <hi>Babylon</hi> is not to be reformed, but to be deſtroyed; Take heed therefore of running a part or a ſhare in the Boat or Veſſel that God hath laid out for deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for if you have a part and a ſhare there, you will look back. But</p>
               <p n="5">5. If you would not look back in declining times, let us conſider in the fear of the Lord, what an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil thing it is to look back: Briefly thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thereby you loſe all you have wrought; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you will loſe all your loſſes; There is much gain in loſing for Jeſus Chriſt; There is gain in our loſſes, by looking back you will loſe all your loſſes, and the gain thereby.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thereby you will loſe the Teſtimony of your own Integrity; Yet ſaith God, <hi>Job</hi> held faſt his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity: And if we don't look back in declining times, then our hearts will tell us, we were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right before him, but if we look back in declining times, our conſciences will tell us we were never right before him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thereby alſo you will loſe the comfort of thoſe glorious times that are to come: Friends and Beloved, glorious times there are a coming, that are at the back ſide of this hedge, that are but a little way off; that are on the back-ſide of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; glorious times that are a coming, and when they come, if ye ſtand and hold out, you will have the comfort of thoſe glorious times: But
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:45432:131"/> if now you look back in the interim, you will loſe the comfort of all thoſe glorious times when they come, and come they will, and come they ſhall.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thereby alſo you will, and ſhall be ſatisfied with your own waies, for the back-ſlider in heart ſhall be ſatisfied with his own waies, you will look back, and you ſhall have enough on't (ſaith God.)</p>
               <p n="5">5. And thereby alſo you will be made unmeet for the Kingdom of Heaven; For he that puts his hand to the Plow, and looks back, is unfit for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And thereby alſo you may be made a Pillar of Salt, and an example unto after Ages; for God is quick with Apoſtates, and with them that do look back: You have heard how quick the Lord was with <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, and ſhe was but a Type. Now therefore, as ever you do deſire (Friends and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) as ever you do deſire, that you may not loſe what you have wrought for ſo many years; as you do deſire that you may hold faſt, and not loſe the gain of your former loſſes; as you do deſire that you may hold faſt your Integrity; as you do deſire that you may have the comfort of thoſe glorious times that are a coming; as you do deſire you may not be ſatisfied with your own waies, and as you do deſire you may not be unfit for the Kingdom of Heaven; and as you do deſire that you may not be made examples for after Ages: I beſeech you in the Name of the Lord, and I deſire this Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may take upon my own heart as well as yours; Let us remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife. It was the Lady <hi>Times</hi> ſpeech to <hi>Harding</hi> that Apoſtate, <hi>Harding, Harding,</hi> Remember <hi>Judas; Harding,</hi> remember
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:45432:132"/> 
                  <hi>Francis Spira:</hi> And let us remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife.</p>
               <p>And if you will ask, How ſhould we ſo remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, that we may not decline in decline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times? Work theſe things upon your hearts; This ſtory and example upon your hearts: Take this for a conſtant Rule, that Paſſion is the beſt door-keeper of Memory: The more I am affected with a thing for the preſent, the more I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it for the future; and therefore if you would remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, go and work this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry now upon your own hearts; and as the times are declining, the more declining the times are, the more do you rub your Memory with this Example of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, and call upon your ſelves: Come O my ſoul remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife: Brethren, Friends, Beloved, our Saviour Chriſt hath left you this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, he hath commanded you and me to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife; 'Tis an Example that he hath ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, that we may take heed hereby, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at all times call upon your ſelves, and your own ſouls; come O my ſoul, haſt thou forgotten <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife? Thou beginneſt to grow cold, and dead, and dull, haſt thou forgotten <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife? Come O my Soul, remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife: Thus ſhall you be able to ſtand, and not to look back, and I pray think upon it, that we may not be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe that draw back unto perdition, but of thoſe that do believe to the ſaving of your ſouls: Think therefore of theſe things, and remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife.</p>
